Ziel ist es, sprachliche Barrierefreiheit in allen Gesellschaftsbereichen zu ermöglichen: in der Bildung, bei politischen und kulturellen Events, durch barrierefreies Streaming von Plenarsitzungen oder großen mehrsprachigen Konferenzen, durch Live-Transkription in Fußballstadien. Durch den Einsatz und die Ausbildung von tauben Gebärdensprachdolmetschern und blinden Schriftdolmetschern schafft das Unternehmen zudem qualifizierte Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten für Menschen mit Handicap.",

That's a fancy way of saying: People who come together, are creative, just do, design and make stuff and by doing so transform the world, bit by bit from the ground up. Hackspaces, Makerspaces, FabLabs, I'm talking about you! I believe that such communities, together with related technologies harbor immense potential for societal change, maybe towards a fairer society (yes, I am a bit of an Anarchist in that regard). However, I don't think that bottom-up culture can or should be limited to high tech ventures - it should be holistic and sustainable which is why I'm also involved in more low tech undertakings like Urban Gardening. Within this weave, I'm concerned with how to design and shape future systems (be they low- or high-tech), machines and interfaces to empower people.\n\nI'm fortunate enough to be able to pursue my work in a research group at the University of Siegen, Germany - a group which is quite focused on practice - meaning we do a lot of work on the ground, with actual people, observing, doing ethnography and develop systems iteratively togther with our users.

I’m lucky to be able to work with friends, who are hopeful and driven enough to try and improve the way we live and work on this planet. Some of our projects are well received. We made an open design game, which was run with Google Labs, the UN and UNICEF. I co-founded Learn Do Share, which is a co-design system that engages people in social innovation through storytelling and making. In 2014, New York City's Columbia University adopted the model as a  “Future of Education Lab”. All that makes me a process designer for collaboration and experiential education, combining my PhD in Media/Design Anthropology with R&D at Reboot Stories. My artistic research was funded by the Australian government and, until now, I taught Innovation and Entrepreneurship (cf. d.school) at the University of Technology Sydney and freelanced with PwC’s boutique consultancy The Difference. Back home in Berlin I’m looking for new projects. Looking forward to chats and planning.",

			"biography": "Michael Schulte kümmert sich seit 20 Jahren um Kindermedien. Angefangen hat alles mit einer Portrait-Reihe für den WDR-\"Kinderfunk\", damals hat er mit insgesamt 20 Promis von Heino bis Gerhard Schröder über deren Kindheit gesprochen. Dann war er als Redakteur für die Deutschlandradio-Kindersendung Kakadu zuständig und hat später mit Ohrka.de ein gemeinnütziges Hörportal gegründet. Aktuell baut Michael zusammen mit Freiwilligen eine erste Wikipedia für Kinder auf: das Klexikon (http://klexikon.de). In der Konzeptionsphase wurde er von Wikimedia Deutschland gefördert.\n\nMedien für Kinder sollen aus Michaels Sicht eine hohe Qualität haben, aber auch kostenlos, werbefrei und jederzeit verfügbar sein. Ein paar Angebote für Kinder haben ihm gefehlt, zum Beispiel ein \"KIKA für die Ohren\" oder eine kindgerechte Alternative zur Wikipedia. Sender und Co. ließen aber auf sich warten, deshalb ergriff er selbst die Initiative.\n\nAuf Ohrka.de können Kinder inzwischen aufwändig produzierte Hörabenteuer im Umfang von 80 Stunden kostenlos anhören und herunterladen - vom Dschungelbuch mit Anke Engelke bis zur Schatzinsel mit Matt Damons deutscher Stimme. Auch das Klexikon wächst: Mit über 500 Artikeln und seinen ersten 50 Autoren ist es bereits so umfangreich wie das DUDEN Schülerlexikon und so aktiv wie kleinere Wikipedia-Schwesterprojekte.\n\nDurch seinen Vortrag auf der re:publica 2015 möchte Michael weitere Unterstützer für diese Ideen gewinnen. Und wer sich am Ausbau und der Verbesserung der Klexikon-Artikel beteiligen will, kann sich über kontakt@klexikon.de gerne bei ihm melden.\n",

As a member of a younger generation she not only questions the traditional manner to which we approach death and funerals’, but also rethinks the business models and the current ways of working.\n\nShe is an active member of the Re.Designing Death movement, convinced that by joining forces with like-minded people you can challenge the statu quo. Together, with Virginie Gailing, she initiated a project to address the following question: How can conversations on death and funerals, loss and farewells be facilitated in a way that inspires people, and lets them enjoy talking about this crucial aspect of our lives?",

			"biography": "Wir begrüßen Sie alle recht schön und winken Ihnen virtuell zu. Nun, unser Angebot richtet sich an Menschen, die sich fragen, für wen sie arbeiten, warum sie arbeiten und wie dieses System »Arbeit« funktioniert.\n\nWem dienen wir, wenn wir eine Karriere machen? Und warum müssen wir uns bewerben, wenn wir nicht »in Arbeit« sind?\n\nKlar ist: Die berufliche Karriere ist derzeit der größte Faktor dafür, wie wertvoll ein Mensch auf dem Markt ist. Die Verteilung von Nahrung, Wohnung, Produkten, Macht und Anerkennung richtet sich dabei nach der beruflichen Stellung innerhalb der Gesellschaft auf unserem schönen Planeten.\n\nWer nicht »in Arbeit« ist, der habe versagt - oder reich geerbt. Wer »in Arbeit« ist, der habe »hart dafür gearbeitet« oder »Glück gehabt«. Wo man auch hinblickt, ploppen Fragezeichen auf: Warum spricht alle Welt von »Demokratie«, »Wahlen« & »Freiheit«, wenn sie in der Wirtschaft keine Rolle spielen? Oder haben Sie Ihren Chef oder Eigentümer gewählt? An wen bezahlen Sie so fleißig Ihre Miete?\n\nWem gehört die Welt?\n\nWir können nicht alles erklären, aber wir möchten dem Phänomen »Arbeit« auf die Spur kommen. Und wir wollen entlang dieser Spur aus diesem hässlichen Labyrinth von unsinnigen Abhängigkeiten herausfinden. Wir meinen: Eine Zeitenwende steht ins Haus. Es könnte besser werden, wenn wir denn etwas dafür tun.\n\nUnd am Ende steht ein Haus.\n\nEin gewisser Mister Bartleby ist dabei unser Namenspatron. Bartleby entspringt Herman Melvilles berühmter Novelle gleichen Namens. Es ist ein Mensch, der allmählich einfach nicht mehr mitmacht. Der höflichste & geheimnisvollste Aussteiger aller Zeiten. Sein Credo »I would prefer not to« ist als die freundliche Absage an den Dienstherren weltberühmt geworden. Was hätte er erschaffen, wenn er sich mit anderen verbunden hätte?\n\nSpeaker-Team für unsere Session »INSTRUCTIONS FOR A CAREER REFUSAL«: Alix Faßmann, Anselm Lenz und Jörg Petzold",

Dazu zählen Aspekte mangelnder Zugänge und Fähigkeiten, sowie die daraus resultierenden Folgen für gesellschaftliche Subgruppen, auch in Bezug auf die Arbeitswelt. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt bilden visuelle Methoden innerhalb der empirischen Sozialforschung und wie sie in traditionelle quantitative und qualitative Ansätze eingebunden werden können bzw. diese miteinander zu verknüpfen helfen.",

During the daytime she focuses her attention on trying to explain what incentivizes political participation as a PhD researcher in Political Economy at King’s College London. But political participation is hardly the only area that fascinates her. Observant of the ever changing societies, she has a great interest in understanding how technology is shaping the future and specifically how social media is shaping our everyday lives. Naturally this goes back to the topic of her academic research as well – how social media today and the social networks around it shape political participation. She has also blogged trying to answer various “Why?”s in political and economic topics and has published Op-Eds in newspapers such as the Telegraph. ",

My interest is in how the physical world of neuronal activity produces the mental world of perception and cognition. My research led me to introduce the concepts of ideasthesia (meaning \"sensing concepts\") and practopoiesis (meaning \"creation of actions\"; http://www.danko-nikolic.com/practopoiesis/). I want to use this theoretical knowledge to create artificial systems that are biologically-like intelligent and adaptive.",

			"biography": "I’ve always disliked school. I quickly became a master at avoiding classes with the exception of those attended by girls I liked and subjects I enjoyed. In any case, I received spectacularly bad grades and in the end I admitted defeat, dropped out and became a musician. A few years later, (through divine intervention or cosmic irony depending how you look at it) I was admitted to the University of Oxford, where I studied philosophy. After I discovered that nobody wanted to pay me for thinking, I took a job at Harley-Davidson. Flushed with funds and bored with motorbikes, I set out on a glamorous new career as a film producer in America. There, I produced some spectacularly unsuccessful films before I discovered an enthralling new trend: \"Transmedia\". I became fascinated with ARGs and their novel approach to audience engagement. I absorbed everything I could find on the subject. Back in Europe, whilst working on a VOD platform I started experimenting with ARGs in schools. Ironically, these experiments were successful and what I learned I would like to share with you.",

Before he came to the Charité in 2009, he studied philosophy and medicine in Freiburg i. Br. and Hannover and then worked as a researcher at the Universities of Copenhagen and Oxford. In Copenhagen, he completed a PhD program on seasonal changes in the environment and their effect on neurotransmission. He described how environments that appear potentially hostile and dangerous are associated with changes in brain chemistry that can lead to more dogmatic behavior. From 2011 to 2014 he headed the neurochemistry research group of his department.\n\nWhile being on a one-year paternity leave in 2014, an older case study he had written on \"Twitter psychosis\" appeared online and caused international attention of the media. He was stunned by this great need for information of the public (combined with a great potential to overreact of the mass media). So when he returned from paternity leave in 2015, he changed his research focus and founded a center for Internet and mental health for which he and his team received the Max Rubner Award - The Innovation Award For Trailblazers At the Charité. \n",

			"biography": "Der Journalist und Schriftsteller Günter Wallraff enthüllt seit fünfzig Jahren Missstände in unserer Gesellschaft, wie Ausbeutung, Rassismus und Unterdrückung. Besonderes Aufsehen erregte Wallraff mit seinen verdeckten Recherchen innerhalb der Redaktion der „Bild-­‐ Zeitung“ als Hans Esser. \"Ganz unten\" aus dem Jahr 1985, Wallraffs Reportage in der Rolle des türkischen Arbeiters \"Ali\" als illegaler Bauarbeiter über den menschenverachtenden Handel mit Leiharbeitern, ist mit über fünf Millionen verkauften Exemplaren das meistverkaufte Sachbuch im Nachkriegsdeutschland. Verdeckt war Wallraff vor kurzem als der obdachlose „Wolfgang“ in Nachtasylen und vor den Schreibtischen von Sachbearbeitern in Wohnungsämtern, als Call‐Agent „Michael G.“ im „Outbound“‐Geschäft oder als Paketauslieferer bei GLS beschäftigt. Seine Erfahrungen sind in dem jetzt in Neuauflage erschienen Buch „Aus der schönen neuen Welt“ zu finden. Für große Resonanz sorgten zuletzt seine Enthüllungen über Burger King, die Pflegebranche oder das Wach- und Sicherheitsgewerbe mit dem „Team Wallraff“ auf RTL.\n\n_____\n\nJournalist and writer Günter Wallraff has revealed injustices in our society such as exploitation, racism and oppression for 50 years. Wallraff created a particular sensation with his undercover research inside the Bild Zeitung’s editorial team as “Hans Esser”. His 1985 report “Ganz unten” (At the bottom), in which Wallraff took on the role of the Turkish “Ali”, an illegal construction worker, in order to examine the inhuman treatment afforded to temporary workers, remains the best-selling non-fiction book in post-war Germany, with more than 5 million copies sold. More recently, Wallraff went undercover as the homeless “Wolfgang”, sleeping in overnight shelters and meeting housing-services case officers; as call-centre agent “Michael G.” in “Outbound”; and as a package-deliverer employed by GLS. His experiences can be found in the newly published book “Aus der schönen neuen Welt” (From the Brave New World). His recent revelations about Burger King, the long-term care industry, and the private security business, produced for his RTL show “Team Wallraff”, have drawn a strong public response.\n\n \n\nGünter Wallraff is a speaker @MEDIA CONVENTION Berlin\n\nFind out more on Twitter: @MCBERLIN15 / #mcb15\n",

Seit 2003 entwickelt sie mit Public Art Lab Kommunikations- und Handlungsformate, welche die Öffentlichkeit in den künstlerischen Prozess einbeziehen und nachhaltige Kooperationen sowie Netzwerke hervorbringen. Diese Projekte bewegen sich stets an der Schnittstelle von urbanem Raum, digitalen Medien, Wirtschaft und Wissenschaften. So wurden beim Medienfassaden Festival Europa 2010 erstmalig sieben europäische Großstädte über Urban Screens und Medienfassaden vernetzt, die sich u.a. während gemeinsamer Joint Broadcasting Events als Sichtfenster für gesellschaftliche und interkulturelle Prozesse öffneten. Die Auseinandersetzung mit urbanen Medien führte Susa Pop 2011 als Projektleiterin des vom Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung geförderten Innovationsforum Urban Screens fort. Weitere Projekte von Public Art Lab sind: Mobile Museen (2004), Mobile Studios (2006), Mobicases (2007, 2009, 2011), Medienfassaden Festival (2008 ) und Round Table Ukraine (2011-13). Im April 2012 erscheint zudem die, unter der Mitherausgeberschaft von Susa Pop entstandene, Publikation Urban Media Cultures (Verlag avedition). Anhand zahlreicher Beispiele aus den Themengebieten Stadtentwicklung, Technologie und Vermarktung zeigt das Buch aktuelle Tendenzen im Bereich interaktiver Medienstrukturen. Connecting Cities (seit 2012) ist ein aktuelles Projekt von Public Art Lab bei dem Susa als Initiatorin, internationale künstlerische Leisterin und lokaler Kurator in Berlin agiert. Weitere aktuelle Projekte sind Human Futures (2012-14), sowie das City Culture Science Lab (2015).",

Neben Moderationen unterschiedlicher Formate u.a. bei ZDF, RTL, ProSieben und Sat 1 debütierte sie 2007 in der ZDF – Telenovela „ Wege zum Glück“ und begann damit auch ihre Schauspielkarriere, die 2009 bereits mit der Rolle der Killerin „Mercedes“ in dem Kinofilm „Mord ist mein Geschäft, Liebling“ einen Höhepunkt erhielt. Nela ist jedoch nicht nur im TV vor der Kamera sehr aktiv. Mit ihrem eigenen Youtube-Channel und begeisterten Twitter- und Facebook-Community ist sie eine der wenigen Moderatorinnen in Deutschland, die die Brücke zwischen TV und Social Media sehr früh und erfolgreich geschlagen hat. Dafür wurde sie auch im Januar 2015 mit dem melty Future Award in der Kategorie „Cool is Everywhere – Deutschland“ ausgezeichnet. Nela, deren gebürtiger Name Daniela Panghy lautet, wurde 1980 in Tettnang am Bodensee geboren und lebt heute im Ruhrgebiet.\n\n_____\n\nNela Lee began her career as a presenter in 2004 with the VIVA music broadcaster, where she hosted the shows Interactiv, Star Search – Das Magazin, Interaktiv in School, and the Inside lifestyle magazine.

However, Lee is not only active in front of the camera on TV. With her own YouTube channel and active Twitter and Facebook communities, she is one of the few presenters in Germany to build an early and successful bridge between TV and social media. For this reason, she was honoured with a melty Future Award in January 2015 in the category “Cool is Everywhere – Germany”.

Eigentlich sieht sie sich selbst ungern als eine Träumerin, sondern eher als die Macherin diverser Projekte und reist deshalb viel. In ihren Gedanken gibt es nur wenig Grenzen.\n\n2011 gründet sie „anderStark – bewegend anders“, das zunächst ein reines Fotoprojekt war, bei dem Frauen mit einer Muskelerkrankung außergewöhnlich in Szene gesetzt wurden. Das Projekt sollte Blickwinkel verändern, neue Welten aufzeigen und offen mit Vorurteilen umgehen. Geplant ist, dass anderStark größer, bekannter und internationaler wird. Mit Ausstellungen und Modeschauen, bei denen behinderte und nicht-behinderte Models gemeinsam die neusten Kreationen von Jungdesignern präsentieren.\n\nDie neue Kampagne, an der Anastasia parallel arbeitet, heißt „inkluWAS – design, das denken verändert“. Zusammen mit der Hamburger Modedesignerin Kathrin Neumann ist ein Design entstanden, das die Bedeutung und Wirkung von „Inklusion“ auf spielerische Weise erklärt.\n\nAnastasia – vom Rollstuhl aus denkend, lachend und philosophierend – findet ihr Leben übrigens völlig „normal“. Schließlich tut sie all die Dinge, die andere Frauen in ihrem Alter auch machen. Und ein bisschen mehr.",

Aus den geplanten Monaten wurden fast drei Jahrzehnte und eine Reise durch 215 Länder.   \n\nHoltorf ist ehemaliger Geschäftsführer der Hapag-Lloyd Flug (1985-1988) und war zuvor viele Jahre (1962-1984) als Stations-/Verkaufsleiter bei Lufthansa an verschiedensten Orten der Welt tätig, unter anderem Santiago de Chile, Las Palmas, Hongkong und Jakarta. Während seiner Zeit in Indonesien begann er den ersten Stadtplan von Jakarta anzufertigen. Aus einem ersten rudimentären Faltplan 1977 wurde bis 2005 ein 400-seitiger Stadtatlas, der bis heute noch von der Stadtverwaltung von Jakarta benutzt wird und eines der größten kartografischen Projekte der Welt darstellt. Bei regelmäßigen Besuchen in Indonesien wurde er von Holtorfs über die Jahre akribisch gepflegt und ergänzt.",

Wenn er das nicht tut, sorgt er in einer anderen Arbeitsgruppe („Die WissenSchaffer“) dafür, aktiv Nerd- und Gender-Stereotype zu zerschlagen, indem er Kindern und Jugendlichen spielerisch algorithmisches Denken, Roboter programmieren und Löten beibringt.

			"description": "Wie lange wird schon theoretisch über das Bedingungslose Grundeinkommen diskutiert? Michael Bohmeyer hatte keine Lust mehr zu warten, sondern hat im Sommer 2014 beschlossen, es jetzt endlich einzuführen. Per Crowdfunding sammelte er 72.000 € und verloste sie an fünf Menschen aus seiner Community. Diese fünf Menschen erhalten nun ein Jahr lang monatlich 1.000 € ohne jede Bedingung ausgezahlt. Einige weitere Grundeinkommen wurden seither durch eine Art Steuer finanziert: Mit einem Browser-Plugin und einer Bonuspunkte-Karte hackt sich die Initiative in den Konsumkreislauf und finanziert damit ständig weitere Grundeinkommen. Auf der Community mein-grundeinkommen.de kann sich jeder Mensch für die Verlosungen anmelden. Auch in dieser Session wird ein Grundeinkommen verlost. Aber was bringt so eine Aktion? \"Nur\" mediale Aufmerksamkeit? Oder könnten crowd- und webbasierte Projekte unser Sozialsystem hacken und die Politik zwingen, tatsächlich etwas zu verändern, weil es in der parallelen Online-Welt schon funktioniert? Dazu zeigen wir Beispiele und präsentieren unsere weiteren Ideen - zum Beispiel, wie wir mit euch die Hartz-4-Sanktionen abschaffen wollen. In echt.\n",

			"title": "\"Online? Bringt uns nichts!\" – Ein deprimierender Lagebericht aus den Chefbüros deutscher Industrieunternehmen.",
			"abstract": "Die deutsche Wirtschaft ist stark geprägt von den „Hidden Champions“ – den überwiegend mittelständischen, inhabergeführten Unternehmen, die in den Tiefen der Provinz den technologischen Fortschritt antreiben. Dass ausgerechnet diese Unternehmen den Anschluss an die digitale Welt verpassen, scheint paradox. Mit Anekdoten aus dem Berateralltag wagt Marco Petracca einen Erklärversuch, der sich vor allem mit den kulturellen Differenzen zwischen Provinz und Netzwelt auseinandersetzt. ",
			"description": "Sobald es um die Wirtschaftsleistung Deutschlands geht, werden Politiker nicht müde zu betonen, wie wichtig sie für uns sind – die sogenannten „Hidden Champions“, die Mittelständler, die Industrie- und Technologieunternehmen, die mit knapp 16 Millionen Beschäftigten rund 2,1 Billionen Euro pro Jahr erwirtschaften. Und obwohl ihr Beitrag wesentlich für den Status Quo Deutschlands ist, werden sie in der Öffentlichkeit so gut wie gar nicht wahrgenommen. Es liegt natürlich daran, das der überwiegende Teil ihrer Produkte und Leistungen keine direkte Relevanz für unser tägliches Leben haben - schließlich braucht niemand eine Rohrbiegemaschine oder eine Industriepumpe im Privathaushalt. Und es liegt auch daran, dass diese Unternehmen meist irgendwo in der tiefen Provinz sitzen. In einer Welt, deren Horizont an der nächsten Autobahn endet und die sehr weit weg von dem ist, was wir im Netz als Arbeitswelt verstehen.\n\nDass diese teils geschichtsträchtigen, oft inhabergeführten, und deshalb manchmal leider auch sehr konservativen Unternehmen in der Netzwelt genauso wenig stattfinden wie in unserem unmittelbaren Alltag, ist ein Problem. Denn wenn heute jeder mit jedem online kommuniziert, Geschäfte zunehmend nicht mehr im sauerländischen Konferenzraum, sondern weltweit im Browser getätigt werden, Arbeitsplätze nach digitaler sexyness ausgewählt werden, das Netzwissen unseren Alltag und unsere Kultur prägt, stellt sich die Frage, wie diese Traditionsunternehmen in Zukunft bestehen sollen.\n\nAls langjähriger Berater für Markenführung in Industrieunternehmen wagt Marco Petracca einen Erklärversuch. Er zeigt auf, dass das Problem nicht die Technik, sondern vielmehr der kulturell schwierige Mix aus Ingenieurs-, Provinz- und Mittelstandsdenken ist. Und dass die Lösung nicht nur darin bestehen kann, deutsche Kleinstädte mit Breitbandinternet an die Netzwelt zu koppeln.\n",

Eine Woche nachdem wir alle das Video von einer Helden-Katze, die einen Jungen gegen einen Hund verteidigte, geteilt haben, stellt sich die Frage, ob es sich um einen Werbe-Stunt der Fracking-Lobby handelte. Kurz nachdem all jene, die Feministinnen schon immer blöd fanden, sich bei Facebook und Twitter über menstruierende Aktivistinnen empörten, stellt sich heraus, dass das Social-Media-Phänomen unter dem Titel #Freebleeding ein getarnter 4chan-Hoax war.

Die deutsch-amerikanischen Beziehungen nehmen schweren Schaden, von dem sie sich bis heute nicht erholt haben. So bringen seine Geheimdienste Barack Obama in eine missliche Lage. Er kann entweder zugeben, davon gewusst zu haben, also mit den außenpolitischen Beziehungen zum wichtigsten europäischen Alliierten fahrlässig gespielt zu haben (was er nicht zugibt) oder einräumen, dass er seine Dienste nicht unter Kontrolle hatte (was er indirekt zugibt, denn er beendet die Praxis defacto).\n\nDaraus kann man zwei Lehren ziehen: erstens, Geheimdienste dürfen alles, es muss allerdings geheim bleiben, denn bei Bekanntwerden, droht immenser Schaden für das Regierungshandeln. Zweitens, es braucht eine politische und demokratisch legitimierte, also parlamentarische, Kontrolle, die darauf abzielt, dass das Agieren der Geheimdienste nicht außenpolitische und andere Ziele des Staates und der Regierung unterläuft.\n\nIch habe meine begründeten Zweifel, dass die erste Lehre jemals in einer Demokratie funktionieren kann. Es wird immer irgendwann und irgendwie an das Licht der Öffentlichkeit gelangen, wenn Geheimdienste ihre Befugnisse überschreiten oder contra-faktisch agieren. Edward Snowden steht nur an der Spitze einer langen Liste von Menschen, deren Verpflichtung ihrem Gewissen gegenüber der Geheimhaltung Grenzen aufzeigen.\n\nWährend sich in den vergangenen zwei Jahrzehnten das Aufgabenprofil der Geheimdienste stark in den Bereich signal intelligence (technische Aufklärung) verschoben hat, ist die Politik der westlichen Staaten unschlüssig geblieben, welche der beiden Optionen sie verfolgen soll. So haben sich die Geheimdienste Handlungsfreiräume erarbeitet, die nicht nur im rechtlichen Graubereich liegen sondern auch klassischen außenpolitischen Akteuren, der Diplomatie, Grenzen auferlegen. Nicht nur in den USA sondern auch in Deutschland sind die Außenministerien in bestimmten Politikbereichen geschwächt, ja sogar dazu gezwungen, eigen Position aufzugeben.\n\nDer Vortrag führt dafür Beispiele an und erläutert, wie sich westliche Staaten aus diesem Dilemma befreien können.\n",

I will borrow heavily from my learnings since co-founding Brainstorm, as well as my vision for online media in Africa based on global and continental trends.\n\nSharing our stories does help shape our society, for it influences our thought process. If you can change how a man thinks, you have a great shot at changing how he acts. You can change how he acts for the better. We will also explore different articles, campaigns, videos and other online content that has been significant in the past year, and their effects - the questions they raised, their perceived strengths and flaws, and whether they created a lasting effect.

			"title": "Surveillance Art und die fehlende Ästhetik der digitalen Massenüberwachung",
			"abstract": "Schon seit Jahren setzen sich einige duzend Künstler in ihren Werken mit sicherheits- und machtpolitisch motivierter Überwachung auseinander. Von Street Art bis Medienkunst gibt es zahlreiche Werke, die einen näheren Blick wert sind – insbesondere unter dem Aspekt der Ästhetik, der in anderen Bereichen oft etwas zu kurz kommt.",
			"description": "\"Surveillance Art\" ist keine eigene Kunstrichtung, sondern eher ein Suchvektor, unter dem sich Werke verschiedenster Gattungen gruppieren lassen. Dazu gehört Banksys berühmtes CCTV-Graffiti \"What are you looking at?\" ebenso wie Trevor Paglens Fotoserie \"Limit Telephotography\". Paglen hielt kilometerweit entfernte Gebäude und Flugzeuge von Militär und Geheimdiensten in verschwommenen Bildern fest. Die Unschärfe wurde zum Symbol der geheimen und doch oft sichtbaren „Black World“ – samt inoffizieller Budgets in Milliardenhöhe und Foltergefängnissen.\n\nEin weiteres Beispiel ist die Installation „The Situation Room“ des Berliner Medienkünstlers Franz Reimer. In einem Nachbau des Raums, in dem Obama und sein National Security Team die Tötung Osama bin Ladens verfolgten, kann der Besucher deren Positionen einnehmen. Doch der Bildschirm vor der Installation zeigt nicht den tödlichen Einsatz, sondern ein digitales Abbild der Besucher in dem Raum. \n\nSolchen Arbeiten können einen emotionalen und ästhetischen – vielleicht sogar persönlichen Zugang zu dem komplexen und oft sehr abstrakten Thema geben. Dieser nimmt in wissenschaftlichen und journalistischen Beiträgen naturgegeben wenig Platz ein, ist für das tiefere Verständnis der Problematik aber nicht unbedeutend. Die digitale Massenüberwachung verfügt über ausgesprochen wenig sinnlich wahrnehmbare Aspekte. So dekorierten beispielsweise zahlreiche Medien ihre Beiträge monatelang mit dem Gesicht Edward Snowdens oder mit Kabelsalat im DE-CIX. Die Problematik blieb nahezu ausschließlich über die Textebene erfahrbar, was zu einer Art ästhetischen Lehrstelle führt.\n\nKunstwerke werden diese Lehrstelle nicht schließen, doch sie können sie thematisieren und vielleicht sogar etwas verkleinern. \n\nDer Vortrag basiert auf Analysen, welche die Kunsthistorikerin Ines Dorian Gütt im Rahmen Ihrer Masterarbeit „Surveillance Art – Institutionelle Überwachung und deren Folgen in ausgewählten zeitgenössischen Kunstwerken“ vornahm.\n",

			"abstract": "A multidisciplinary research group at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the University of Amsterdam conducted a large-scale empirical social, economic and legal study of Alternative Compensation Systems (ACS), which, for a small monthly fee would legalize currently copyright infringing online practices. We have shown that digital consumers and pirates show strong support for such a non-market based way of paying for digital content, and they are willing to put their money where their mouth is.  The ACS idea enjoys considerable legitimacy, and would be welfare enhancing. \r\nBut it would also completely upset the status quo. What are the consequences?\r\n\r\n",
			"description": "Last year we set out to explore the legal, economic and social feasibility of an Alternative Compensation System (CCS), which, for a small monthly fee would legalize currently infringing online social practices such as private copying from illegal sources and online sharing of copyrighted works. We were interested in whether an ACS that would solve the problem of online copyright infringement would be legally possible, welfare increasing and socially acceptable. We found that the ACS idea in general is not only legally feasible, but can enhance social welfare. We also found that the CCS idea enjoys considerable social support among a representative sample of Dutch citizens.\n\nInterestingly enough, this support is the strongest among those who already use legal access alternatives the most: pirates and digital consumers. In effect, the more someone uses the current legal alternatives, the more he or she is inclined to support the ACS idea. We interpret the support for the ACS alternative as a discontent with the status quo, with the currently available legal alternatives.\n\nDiscontent consumers are joining the ever growing number of authors and performers who express their frustration with the royalties streaming services offer, and the level of control these new, but immensely powerful intermediaries have over the access to audiences. An ACS-based alternative would not necessarily increase the control of artists over distribution, but at least it would weaken the exclusive position of current digital intermediaries, while providing higher levels of revenue then the status quo.  All of these arguments seem to be in support of the CCS idea. Whether that is enough to initiate a change, is the main question of the talk.\n",

			"abstract": "Approximately 1/3 of all Facebook-Accounts already belong to deceased users and the numbers are rising. About 10.000 Facebook users die every day. And Facebook, of course, is not the only relevant platform. Death has long since arrived online – but how should we handle it? What happens with the digital legacy of a user? Does the digital death always follow the physical death?",
			"description": "Probably all of us have already been confronted with the topic of death on the Internet. After the death of a loved one we look up online what we are supposed to do in such a situation. Condolences are often expressed online (especially if the deceased is only distant acquaintance), and posted in social media. These are all interesting aspects of the digital death, which I’ll consider in my talk. But what I find particularly interesting is a different dimension of the digital afterlife. A dimension that affects a growing proportion of society, but is only consciously considered by very few. An issue that affects everyone who uses online services and enters personal information there. What happens to this information after we die? Is the physical death necessarily followed by the digital death?\n\nI could say – “I don’t care what happens to my digital accounts after I die, I’m dead anyway”. But it’s not that easy. What would happen if I would die tomorrow? As I’m not married, my parents would be the ones, who would have to deal with it. And they are definitely not “digital natives”. They wouldn’t have a clue which services I used to use and how to deal with them after I die. They wouldn’t know about my preferences either: would I have wanted everything to disappear? Would I prefer a “memorial profile” (which is for example possible on Facebook)? Or maybe I would have just liked everything to stay as is? If I don’t want my parents to have one more thing to deal with (as if the death of their child wasn’t enough) – maybe I should take care of it while I’m still alive?\n\nBut how? There are already different services trying to help users to manage their digital afterlife. But they struggle. Why?\n\nPeople just don’t want to deal with their own death – especially while being young and healthy;\n\tIt’s difficult to get user feedback (for example conduct user tests) in the context of death;\n\tIt’s difficult to verify the death of the user – in a way which is both user-friendly and highly secure;\n\tThere are no universal standards and regulations: neither for reporting the death of the user nor for creating a last will for digital data.\n \n\nIn my talk I will address these and other questions and constraints and provide answers and recommendations: based on research and the learning from the digital afterlife project I’m currently working on.\n",

			"description": "Trinken ist eine jahrhundertealte westliche Kulturtechnik, und eine, die inzwischen in die Krise geraten ist: Einerseits kann gar nicht genug gewarnt werden vor alkoholinduzierten gesundheitlichen Schäden und moralischem Verfall. Andererseits wird einem überall das Glas unter die Nase gehalten, als wäre jeder Augenblick unter 1,5 Promille verschwendete Zeit. Die Zeitungen sind voller Warnungen, und die Speisekarten voller Spirituosen.\n\nDer Graben ist groß geworden zwischen Alk und Anti. Wer hin und wieder ein Glas Wein zur Entspannung trinkt, gilt vielen Statistiken schon als funktionaler Alkoholiker; wer erklärt, bisweilen bis zur Hirnerweichung abwechselnd Schnaps und Bier in sich reinzukippen, steht kurz vor der ersten ernsthaften Familienintervention. Scheint fast so, als wäre Upton Sinclair Pate für das öffentliche Sprechen über Alkohol gestanden. Der hat mal gesagt: \"Alkohol arbeitet für die Kommunisten. Der Schnaps bescherte ihnen schon die Wasserstoffbombe.\"\n\nZeit, ein paar alte Fragen neu zu stellen: Darf man abhängig sein und wenn ja, wie sehr? Gibt es sie, die feine Art des Saufens? Aus welchen Gründen soll man trinken, und wie viel Sorgen muss man sich dabei machen? Und was bringt das überhaupt: trinken?\n",

			"description": "“Nudging” ist ein Hot topic, spätestans seit Cass Sunsteins und Robert Thalers gleichnamigen Buch, das das Konzept der gesteuerten Verhaltensänderung durch kleine Anstöße unter dem Label “liberaler Paternalismus” propagiert. Barack Obama und James Cameron haben sich schon von den Autoren beraten lassen. Auch die Bundesregierung stellt Verhaltensforscher ein, um “alternative Designs von politischen Vorhaben” zu entwickeln.\n\nKritiker sehen – befeuert durch das Internet der Dinge – einen manipulativen Soft-Totalitarismus heraufdämmern. Dabei sind manipulative Tweaks der Umwelt zu Zwecken einer verzerrten Entscheidungsarchitektur längst allgegenwärtig: von Straßenhubbeln zur Verkehrsberuhigung über psychologisch optimierte Speisekarten bis zu Lockvögel-Angeboten (Decoys), die unsere Preisvorstellungen unterminieren.\n\nDie Frage ist: cui bono? Wer zieht Nutzen aus Nudging? Sind die Ziele zu begrüßen, die Methoden transparent, und die Akteure legitimiert? Unter geklärten Umständen kann Nudging zu einem neuen Design-Paradigma für Politik und Alltag werden, das tatsächlich die Welt verbessern hilft.\n",

Juli 2014)\n\nDer Keramikmesserblock, die Bluetooth-Stereoanlage oder der Katzenkalender 2015: Eine Kaufentscheidung will angesichts fragmentierter Lebensentwürfe wohl bedacht sein - sie kann Orientierung geben oder sogar zur Entfremdung führen. In einer Welt, die mit Werbung und PR durchsetzt ist, bietet die Produktrezension die Möglichkeit, ein Produkt auf seine tatsächlichen Leistungen, Inhalte und Eigenschaften zu reduzieren und zu bewerten. Hier kann Konsumentinnensouveränität wiedergewonnen werden, besonders in Bereichen, in denen die Nachfrage der Kundinnen oft als nicht (mehr) ausschlaggebend für das Angebot wahrgenommen wird.\n\nPrinzipiell jede (mit Internetzugang) kann sich hier verwirklichen – noch nicht mal der tatsächliche Besitz oder Kauf des Produkts ist Voraussetzung für einen Beitrag. Jede Konsumentin hat so die Möglichkeit selber zur Produzentin zu werden. Die Produktrezension ist _die_ Möglichkeit, im Internet Content zu produzieren, ohne dauerhaft Teil von sozial und/oder technisch komplexen Plattformen sein zu müssen. (Online) konsumieren tun wir schließlich fast alle.\n\nOb aber Textfragment aus einer zeitgenössischen Theaterperformance oder Rezension zum Schnellhefter – die Grenzen sind mittlerweile fließend. Als “Auftritt des Alltags” schwankt die Rezension zwischen Authentizität und Selbstinszenierung. Wir begreifen daher in dieser Lesung das Internet als einen theatralen Raum und geben der Produktrezension, deren Ästhetik bisher weitgehend unbeachtet blieb, eine Bühne.\n\n \n\n* Aus pragmatischen Gründen verwenden wir hier das generische Femininum.

Looking at what we share and what is different we learn something about ourselves and about Saudi Arabia, a country that is much more than the onedimensional representations you'll find in the media.

The elusiveness of spam in EU legislation shows how power is exercised by not defining it as a distinct category. Through an interactive map of spam in the European Union, you will see how spam travels across different laws, Directives, agreements and organizations, and how it manages to escape legislation. This talk will examine what it means for your involvement in the online environment, and importantly - who benefits from it.\n",

Anfänglich war diese Bewegung von MakerInnen, Ausprobieren und auch europäischer Open-Source-Technologie geprägt. Doch jetzt steigen die grossen Konzerne und Verbände ein, und versuchen über Industrie-Standards und Closed-Source Lösungen dem wilden Treiben ein Ende zu bereiten. Gibt es noch eine Chance für ein offenes Internet of Things?   ",
			"description": "Spätestens seit Cisco mit dem \"Internet of Everything\" wirbt, und der Daimler-Chef auf der CES die Keynote hält dürfte allen klar sein - das Internet of Things ist keine Spielwiese mehr, sondern wird zunehmend von den grossen Firmen als riesige Geschäfts-Chance gesehen. Die Wachstumszahlen sind auch gigantisch, bereits jetzt kommunizieren in den meisten Netzen mehr Maschinen miteinander als Menschen, Autos, Flugzeugturbinen und Babywindeln sind mit dem Netz verbunden und produzieren Daten im Sekundentakt. \n\nAnfangs war diese Bewegung stark von der Maker-Kultur geprägt und vor allem auch von zwei Hardware-Plattformen aus Europa - zum einen dem Raspberry Pi aus England, zum anderen der Arduino-Plattform aus Italien. Beide aus universitären Projekten entstanden, offen und zunächst so überraschend leistungsschwach, dass die grossen Player die Bewegung ignorierten. Doch das hat sich geändert. Intel hat auf der Maker-Faire in Rom seine neue Plattform vorgestellt, Microsoft bietet Cloud-Lösungen für Maker an und vermutlich bald auch Hardware, Cisco will vorne dabei sein usw. - zusätzlich laufen im Hintergrund intensive Bemühungen die Protokolle und Standards für das IoT festzulegen, amerikanische Firmen sind dabei führend, aus Europa spielt bestenfalls noch Siemens mit. Siemens!\n\nDie grosse Chance, dieses neue Netz der Dinge von unten zu gestalten, droht uns damit in den Fingern zu zerrinnen. Zugleich wird die alltägliche Macht dieses Netzes ungleich grösser sein, denn das IoT wird unser Auto steuern, die Toilette, die Haustüre und mit unseren Gesundheitsdaten Versicherungen und Arbeitgeber glücklich machen.

			"description": "Der „Pangalaktische Donnergurgler“ aus „Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis“ war das erste Rezept bei Chefkoch.de. Ab 1998 konnten Nutzer Rezepte in die Datenbank eintragen, ein Kochforum wurde installiert, und daraus entwickelte sich organisch eine Community, die nun fast jeder deutschsprachige Internetnutzer kennt. Doch es brodelt in der Foodie-Welt: Wir erleben die digitale Disruption der Lebensmittelkette: vom Startup „Soylent“ über grüne Smoothies vom Food-Truck hin  zum stylischen Molekyleis am Stiel aus Kreuzberg. Da stellt sich die Frage: Wer veröffentlicht als erstes ein Rezept für 3D-Food-Printer auf Chefkoch.de?\n\nDie klassische Forenkultur ist eine etablierte und wertvolle Form des Miteinanders im Internet. Doch Social Networks und die Blogosphäre haben die Möglichkeiten von Kollaboration und Kommunikation erweitert. Was heißt das aber für eine Plattform wie Chefkoch.de? Sollen wir das \"Facebook für Foodies“ werden oder das \"Instagram für Food-Hipster“? Sollen unsere redaktionellen Texte und Videos künftig ausschließlich „User-generated“ sein? Wie sollen wir mit Bloggern, Vloggern und Instagramern zusammenarbeiten? Was können Events und Camps für alle Beteiligten leisten?\n\nDie Ausgangssituation für eine Koch-Community der nächsten Generation sind jedenfalls bestens: Chefkoch.de hat eine starke Nutzerbasis. Die Food-Szene ist voll aktiv und kreativ. Kochen ist seit Jahren ein Top-Trend... Wir geben Einblicke in unsere Aktivitäten und Ideen – und wir sind offen für Anregungen, um ein Miteinander in der Zukunft zu gestalten.\n",

You call the hospital and the organ library, within a week you have a new heart.\r\n\r\nThis tech is currently being developed. Many say that it make us less human because it intervenes with nature. Others say that such interventions allow us to focus on what \"being human\" actually means. In each case we are hesitant to let technology integrate with our bodies.\r\n\r\nShould we be scared of the consequences of an increasingly technological world?",
			"description": "It is a given that within the next couple of years technology will develop exponentially. Many scientists, designers and futurists therefore focus on what the new opportunities of these developments are. Unfortunately they somehow do not focus on the consequences. Concepts like telepathy, brain upgrading pills and implanted LED displays are pretty cool, but they radically alter our society and our human body. \n\nAs the integration of technology with our body is imminent we need to start thinking about its impact. A new generation of designers has risen to question our technological progress. We put these new technologies into context by designing physical objects which could be part of a future society. They are future scenarios to figure out what kind of impact these technologies could have on our lives and on being human. \n\nThe debate which revolves around these objects we, as a society, can decide wether or not we need to proceed with these developments. And maybe more important wether or not we need to take precautions. \n\nAll new technologies could be the asbestos of the future so we better start thinking about their consequences now.

Wir von CORRECT!V – dem ersten gemeinnützigen Recherchebüro in Deutschland – wollen verstehen, wie diese Menschen leben, wovon sie träumen. Dafür haben wir über viele, viele Wege und Kontakte einen mehrsprachigen Fragebogen im Internet verbreitet – und wollen für Euch die Geheimnisse dieser besonderen Recherche lüften. ",
			"description": "Wir wollen Migrantinnen und Migranten in der Illegalität sichtbar machen. Mindestens fünf Millionen Einwanderer in die Europäische Union können ihre bürgerlichen Rechte nicht umsetzen – so viele, wie im gesamten Ruhrgebiet oder im Großraum Berlin. Sie haben eigentlich keine Erlaubnis, sich bei uns aufzuhalten, sie dürfen hier nicht arbeiten, können nicht zur Schule gehen und sind für die meisten von uns unsichtbar. Jeder hundertste Mensch, dem wir begegnen, führt ein verstecktes Leben. Sie wohnen in einem Zimmer des Mietshauses nebenan, sie bereiten schwarz in Restaurants unser Essen zu, sie reinigen für einen Hungerlohn unsere Büros und sie ziehen auf Baustellen Mauern hoch.\n\nAber wir kennen sie nicht. Wer sind sie wirklich? Wie leben und wohnen sie? Was sind ihre Träume und Visionen? Und wer sind ihre Nutznießer? Welche Betriebe könnten ohne ihre illegale Beschäftigung gar nicht überleben? Wo sehen sich diese Menschen in fünf Jahren? Wir verleihen den Menschen in der Illegalität eine Stimme.\n\nDie Unsichtbaren bauen auf einem Projekt auf, dass wir in den vergangenen Monaten mit freien Journalisten aus Portugal, Spanien, Italien und Griechenland umgesetzt haben. Das Projekt \"GenerationE\". Hier haben junge Migranten aus Südeuropa ihre Erfahrungen in einem Fragebogen geteilt und wir haben ihre Geschichten unter generatione.correctiv.org erzählt. Die Recherche zu den Unsichtbaren ist die nächste Stufe. Jetzt wenden wir uns denen zu, die bislang überhaupt keine Lobby haben.\n\nWir wollen Euch auf der re:publica zeigen, wie wir in monatelanger Arbeit mit diesen Menschen in Kontakt gekommen sind, und wie wir gerade die größte europäische Datenbank über Menschen in der Illegalität aufbauen. Denn bislang fehlt selbst der Europäischen Union jegliche Idee darüber, wie der Alltag dieser vielen Menschen aussieht. Wir lüften das Geheimnis.\n",

			"abstract": "The European crisis has brought new challenges and dangers for critical journalism. Cuts to budgets not only make the day to day more difficult but leave institutions weakened to the advances of corruption, those in power jockeying to turn the press into personal PR machines. Coupled with recent revelations about systematic surveillance of investigative journalists, there is no doubt a pressing need for innovation and communication between fellow journalists. We’ll be exploring the recent boom in cross border journalistic initiatives and asking what role collaborative journalism has to play in Europe’s new Digital Society. ",
			"description": "Journalists are reaching across borders to collaborate and communicate about issues from the mundane to massive breaking stories. Are the collaborative stories produced by, and the support fostered within these networks central to creating Europe’s new ‚Digital Society‘?\n\nAt last year’s re:publica, we launched our own non-profit journalism platform: hostwriter.org. Hostwriter is a global platform designed to encourage and facilitate collaboration between journalists, bloggers and documentary filmmakers. Members become part of a network that enables them to easily find and contact fellow journalists for local advice, offers of co-authorship or even accommodation („couchsurfing for journalists“).\n\nOn our first birthday, we’d like to return to #RP15 to hold a panel discussion and critical debate with other leading figures from the collaborative movement that explores journalism’s role within ‚Europe’s Digital Society‘.  We’ll ask whether the challenges facing Europe can in fact catalyse more meaningful collaboration between journalists.  Can the work of cross border journalism break longstanding stereotypes? Can they not only sidestep national corruptions and limitations but shine light on to them?  Ultimately, can journalistic cross border collaboration create a more open society that transcends the digital?\n",

Aber das Internet ist nicht nur eine weitere Form, mit bisher Unbekannten in Kontakt zu treten. Es ändert auch die Art, wie wir Beziehung wahrnehmen und leben.",
			"description": "Die Qual der Wahl\n\nWer weiß, was für einen Partner er oder sie sucht, findet online schnell ein passendes Forum. Wer es nicht weiß, kann viel entdecken und wer Abwechslung oder sich sexuell ausprobieren möchte, wird ebenfalls fündig. Das Internet ist ein Ort unglaublich vielfältiger Möglichkeiten. Dabei könnte man sich fragen, ob uns das Angebot überfordert oder uns verführt, traditionelle Vorstellungen von Bindung zu überdenken.\n\nDie Beziehung im Schaufenster\n\nAuf jeden Fall sind Beziehung, Alleinsein und alles dazwischen öffentlicher denn je, sie sind für viele Menschen Teil der digitalen Selbstdarstellung. Diese wird nicht nur in den Feuilltons gern als Zeichen von Narzissmus interpretiert. Das ist nicht zwingend falsch. Sie kann aber auch der Auslotung eigener Bedürfnisse dienen.\n\nBitte eine Tüte Gemischtes \n\nUnd eventuell stellt man im Spannungsfeld zwischen Selbstinszenierung und Angebotsvielfalt plötzlich auch klassische Rollen- und Beziehungsmodelle in Frage. Dabei kann man online vielfältige Einblicke in alternative Partnerschaftskonzepte nehmen. Aus der starr wirkenden monogamen Tradition unseres Kulturkreises wird für Interessierte eine Welt voller theoretischer und bereits gelebter Möglichkeiten sichtbar. Begleitet wird das von gesellschaftlichen Entwicklungen, die tradierte Ehe-Grundlagen wie konservative Moralvorstellungen oder die ökonomische Abhängigkeit der Frau vom Ernährer, aufheben.\n\nLiebe ist gut für alle\n\nDie Rezeption neuer Formen von Bindung ist wahrscheinlich zunächst einmal auf eine digitalaffine Bohème beschränkt. Gleichwohl zeigt die Entwicklung in anderen Themenbereichen, wie schnell sie ihren Weg in den Mainstream finden. Beziehung und Liebe entkoppeln sich zunehmend von Ökonomie und moralischen Traditionen und emanzipieren sich so zu einem freiwilligen Konzept, das auch neuen Strukturen gegenüber offen ist. Das Internet fungiert hier - wie in vielen anderen gesellschaftlichen und wirtschaftlichen Bereichen - als Katalysator und Beschleuniger.\n",

Nur deswegen kann ich mich darauf verlassen, dass die Tweetleser das nötige Hintergrundwissen haben, um alles nicht Gesagte selber ergänzen zu können.\n\nIn dem Vortrag “Ceci n’est pas un tweet” versuche ich, an Beispielen immens lustiger (und weniger lustiger) Tweets klarzumachen, welche Voraussetzungen gegeben sein müssen, damit Lustigsein in 140 Zeichen funktioniert.\n\nEventuell male ich Venn-Diagramme, um dem höchst wissenschaftlichen Anspruch des Vortrags gerecht zu werden. Vor allem aber wird es viele lustige Tweets als Beispiele geben, so dass sich das Kommen auf jeden Fall lohnen wird.\n",

So Vielfältig das Urheberrecht, von Musik- und Videostreaming über digitale Bibliotheken bis hin zu Remixkunst und -kultur, überall dominiert im Netz die individuelle Rechteklärung im Einzelfall. Auswege gäbe es zwar, für diese müssten sich aber Kunstschaffende™ und Netzgemeinde™ zusammenraufen. Solange das scheitert, freut sich Google.",
			"description": "Der US-Popstar Tayor Swift begründete die Entfernung ihrer Musik aus dem Repertoire von des Musikstreaming-Anbieters Spotify mit Kritik an der Kostenloskultur im Netz - und das obwohl Spotify entweder Gebühren- oder Werbefinanziert ist. Tatsächlich ist im Internet nicht Kostenlos-, sondern Bewilligungskultur das Problem. Nicht die vielbeklagten Schwierigkeiten mit der Rechtsdurchsetzung, sondern, im Gegenteil, übermäßig starke und vielfältige Möglichkeiten zur individualsierten Rechtsausübung erschweren neue Geschäftsmodelle.\n\nIm Ergebnis bleiben digitale Angebote hinter analogen Pendants zurück. Während jedes Lokalradio vollständigen und legalen Zugriff auf das Weltrepertoire der Musik hat, gibt es keine Streamingdienste mit Vollrepertoire. Aber der Musikbereich ist keine Ausnahme, sondern der Regelfall: ähnliches gilt für Online-Videotheken, für digitale Bibliotheken, für Mashups und Remixkunst sowie für Remixkultur im Allgemeinen.\n\nIn all diesen Beispielen gibt es konkrete Beispiele dafür, wie es anders möglich wäre: Webradios könnten Vorbild für Streaming sein, Videotheken für Videostreaming, die norwegische Nationalbibliothek zeigt vor, was im Buchbereich möglich wäre, Musikremixes ließen sich wie Cover-Versionen legalisieren und Remixkultur durch Fair-Use in Europa erlauben. \n\nSolange Politik und Verwertungsgesellschaften die dafür notwendigen, kleinen Anpassungen aber verweigern, profitiert von der herrschenden Bewilligungskultur die einzige grenzüberschreitend funktionierende Rechteklärungsinstanz im Internet: Google bzw. dessen Tochter YouTube. \n",

			"title": "Learn Do Share – Open Design Game",
			"abstract": "Do you believe the future of Europe is in your hands? We think you should! \r\n\r\nThis card game is a rapid prototyping workshop for 6-18 players. The session uses story in a way that you probably haven’t experienced before. Think solution design workshop meets sci-fi story. You play in 3 groups - Storytellers, Designers and The Future. Your challenge is to turn a dystopia into a utopia by inventing a new system or technology. It's a collaborative session that asks you to drop your sense of reality in favour of some mad speculative future design. Expect dreaming, absurdity, laughter, hugging, high fives and intense productivity.",
			"description": "This is how it works First, you will decide on a design question around Finding Europe. Then you invent and prototype an innovation to turn your vision into a reality. At the same time you’ll come up with a story of how your idea comes into the world. Playing cards guide you to write a narrative with obstacles and drama, a climax, and sword fights if you want. The aim is to finish with a concept that can be developed by some or all of you. To win this game, everyone is required to co-operate, not compete. \n\nSo, more detailed, the session always starts with a story that places everyone in a sci-fi world and gives you roles. Three groups are formed: the “Designers” find a strategy to solve the design question; the “Storytellers” implement the designers’ concept into a story that describes how the solution can work given the current context and opposing forces (e.g. antagonist or obstacles); the third group represents “The Future”. They challenge and inform the other groups by providing futurist technologies and needs of certain stakeholders. The groups cannot freely communicate with other groups, so the challenge is to synthesize design and story as best as possible. At the end, a card prompts one of you to record the outcome as a three-minute video pitch involving a storyboard that you created throughout the game. \n\nA bit of theory The narrative design of the workshop is modelled after Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey. Both the story’s protagonist and each participant are heroes and heroines. Their paths become entwined as they tell their story while working out a solution to their shared problem. At the same time the participants are guided through a typical design process. This involves user-centric methods, such as formulating a problem statement, investigating stakeholders and context, brainstorming and rapidly prototyping ideas. Following a narrative, the workshop game resembles a typical design process, which works because story and design draw on the same principles to create meaning. A story follows four steps: challenge, conquer, change and prevail. A design process follows four similar steps: analyze, ideate, develop, test. Bringing these two together like we do in our game is quite unique and we haven’t yet heard from anyone, who has seen this done elsewhere.\n",

			"description": "Vorgestellt werden in der Session zwei selbst durchgeführte Studien zum Digitalen Journalismus: Die erste Studie nimmt in den Blick, inwieweit sich der „Digitale Journalismus“ inzwischen professionalisiert hat, welche Rolle die Teilhabe des Publikums und die technische Automatisierung in den Redaktionen spielen. Um die Dynamik des Digitalen Journalismus praxisadäquat reflektieren zu können, wurden sechs empirische Untersuchungsbausteine eingesetzt, darunter eine quantitative Inhaltsanalyse partizipativer Formen und Formate im Digitalen Journalismus und eine qualitative Deskription der partizipativen Angebote auf ausgewählten journalistischen Websites, Leitfadengespräche mit Redaktionsverantwortlichen sowie eine Beobachtung von Arbeitsprozessen und Automatisierungstendenzen in Online-Redaktionen. Die Studie zeigt, warum die Partizipation des Publikums und der Digitale Journalismus im Idealfall ein Verhältnis gegenseitiger Stimulanz eingehen können, Beide Seiten profitieren, tendenziell verbessert sich die Kommunikationsökologie der Gesellschaft.\n\nDie zweite Studie \"Die Zeitungsmacher\" gibt Auskunft über die Arbeitszufriedenheit, Veränderungsbereitschaft und Innovationsbedarfe von Printjournalisten. Insbesondere die Zeitungsbranche steht unter immensem Druck, die Pressevielfalt nimmt ab. Die anhaltenden Verwerfungen in den internationalen Pressemärkten haben zur Wahrnehmung einer lang anhaltenden „Zeitungskrise“ geführt. Empirische Daten zur Stimmungslage in dieser Umbruchsphase liegen bislang kaum vor. Um nun die tatsächlichen Bedingungen in deutschen Zeitungsredaktionen zu erforschen, wurde die zweite der beiden Studien umgesetzt: Erhoben wurde unter anderem Arbeitszufriedenheit, strukturelle Bedingungen für Innovationen und Veränderungsbereitschaft in den Redaktionen. Ziel: Eine fundierte Analyse der Auswirkungen des digitalen Strukturwandels auf die konkrete journalistische Arbeitssituation und die handwerklichen Perspektiven der Redaktionsarbeit. Der Untersuchungsansatz: Den Konflikt zwischen unternehmerischen Herausforderungen und den gestiegenen Ansprüchen an die redaktionelle Handlungsfähigkeit der Akteure auszuloten.Grundlage bildet eine repräsentative Redaktionsbefragung von Tageszeitungen in Deutschland.",

			"abstract": "Wir dachten, das Netz sei ein Medium der Information, der Bildung, der Aufklärung. Doch heute ist mehr Propaganda, Fake und Manipulation denn je. Während seriöse Angebote als \"Lügenpresse“ beschimpft werden, wird den obskursten Quellen umso blinder geglaubt. \r\nWas passiert da? Was sind das für Leute? Warum tun sie das? Und wie stoppt man sie?",
			"description": "Ist das Netz nun eigentlich die Aufklärungsmaschine, auf die wir immer gehofft haben? Der Schoß, der die Wikipedia gebar? Oder aber ein Gruselkabinett voller Verschwörungstheorien, ein Paradies für Propaganda? Land of the Facts oder Home of the Trolls? Angesichts von Impfgegner-Wahnsinn, 50-Cent-Partei und „Lügenpresse“-Wutbürgern fragt man sich heute mehr denn je: Sind das nur ein paar Verwirrte? Oder gar Vorboten eines dunklen Zeitalter der Desinformation? Was sind das eigentlich für Leute? Welche globale Verschwörung steckt hinter ihren Verschwörungstheorien? Und wer sind eigentlich wir, die wir denken im Besitz der „Wahrheit“ zu sein? Gibt´s die überhaupt (noch)?\nFragen über Fragen. Die Antwort lautet wie immer: Jein. \nUm ein wenig Licht ins Dunkel zu bringen, unternimmt der Vortrag eine Tour de Force durch die schlimmsten Spinnereien, die gefährlichsten Manipulationen, aber auch die tollsten Wahrheitslabore, die man online finden kann. Der Talk versucht zu erklären, was Lüge eigentlich ist und wie sie digital funktioniert (oder eben nicht). Inklusive einer oberflächlichen quantitativen Analyse der Pegida-Klage von der \"Lügenpresse\" und einem kleinen Exkurs zur vermeintlichen Fälschungssicherhheit von Bewegtbild.\nAber auch der Begriff der Wahrheit und seine Instrumentalisierung werden kritisch durchleuchtet: Was ist das, Wahrheit? Und wie geht es der alten Dame heute so?\nDie wichtigste Frage ist aber, warum Menschen sich freiwillig aus jedem satisfaktionsfähigen Diskurs entfernen, und was man tun kann, damit sie nicht außer Reichweite geraten. Und natürlich, wer wirklich auf dem Mond war.\n",

			"abstract": "Mit dem Islamischen Staat (IS) hat ein „terroristisches Start-up“ die Bühne betreten. Als böser Zwilling innovativer Medienformate wie Vice oder Buzzfeed bedient sich der IS virtuos der Mechanismen des Social Webs und setzt statt auf herkömmliche Medienarbeit voll auf „Content Marketing.“ \r\n\r\nDoch dürfen wir das überhaupt so nennen? Wir behaupten: wir müssen. Denn nur so können wir die der Propaganda zu Grunde liegenden Absichten und Wirkungen erkennen – und was wir dazu beitragen. ",
			"description": "Ein mehrsprachiges Corporate Publishing-Magazin, eine Webserie, die in 1-2-minütigen Folgen einen Einblick in den Alltag vermitteln soll und zahlreiche, mit Musik unterlegte Recruitingvideos. Dazu ein weitverzweigtes Netzwerk von Sympathisanten auf fast allen populären sozialen Netzwerken, zahlreiche eigene Plattformen und bald vielleicht ein eigener TV-Sender. Es gibt fast nichts aus dem Arsenal moderner Unternehmenskommunikation, auf das die Propaganda des Islamischen Staates nicht zugreifen könnte.\n\nDazu hat der IS unter dem Namen Al Hayat Media Center ein schlagkräftiges Medienhaus aufgebaut, das vor allem Inhalte produziert, die sich viral über das Internet verbreiten sollen. Stilistisch orientieren sich die Medienmacher des IS an populären Filmen und Videospielen. Bei der Verbreitung ihrer Inhalte nutzen sie die enorme Dynamik und Reichweite der sozialen Netzwerke. Mit dieser Strategie umgeht der IS die traditionellen Gatekeeper und spricht sein Publikum direkt an.\n\nAls ein stilistisches Vorbild der Aktivitäten des IS kann unter anderem das Magazin Vice gelten. Vice bietet seinem vorwiegend jungen Publikum im Web eine multimediale Mischung aus Alltäglichem, Unterhaltung und provokanten Beiträgen. Genau diese Jugendkultur haben auch die Köpfe hinter der IS-Propaganda im Blick. Doch während Vice den freiheitlichen westlichen Lebensstil und dessen Streben nach Selbstverwirklichung feiert, spricht der IS diejenigen an, die genau daran nicht teilhaben können oder wollen.\n\nWir folgen den Spuren der IS-Propaganda im Netz, analysieren Aufbau und Gestaltung der Formate – und erschrecken bisweilen darüber, wie ähnlich sie der Medienwelt sind, die wir kennen und schätzen.\n",

Der Talk des Medienprofessors Bernhard Pörksen beschreibt mit vielen aktuellen Beispielen die Aktions- und Rollenmuster der fünften Gewalt im Überblick. \r\n",
			"description": "Die etablierten Medien gelten als die vierte Gewalt. Im digitalen Zeitalter ist jedoch eine fünfte Gewalt hinzu gekommen, die schon länger existiert, aber noch nicht umfassend beschrieben wurde. Sie besteht aus den vernetzten Vielen, die längst selbst zur publizistischen Macht geworden sind. Sie verändern die Agenda und das Tempo des klassischen Journalismus, veröffentlichen auf Blogs, Wikis, in sozialen Netzwerken, werden als Medienkritiker und Meinungskorrektiv aktiv, bilden Protestgemeinschaften, treiben bei Bedarf die Entlarvungs- und Enthüllungsarbeit voran, stürzen Politiker, bringen Unternehmen in Bedrängnis und erschaffen kluge Gegenöffentlichkeiten. Und sie finden sich mitunter zum grausamen Mobbingspektakel zusammen. Ein Agendasetting von unten, Medienkritik, Fahndungs- und Entlarvungsarbeit bis hin zur brutalen Attacke – all das sind Rollen- und Aktionsmuster der fünften Gewalt.\n\nIst das nun gut oder schlecht? Die Antwort lautet: Es kommt darauf an, denn die fünfte Gewalt hat unendlich viele Gesichter, eine schillernde Individualität. Sie ist hässlich, klug, sensibel und fanatisch. Der Vortrag zeigt mit vielen aktuellen, witzigen, aber auch erschreckenden Beispielen, dass weder die pauschale Euphorie („Schwarmintelligenz“) noch das ähnlich pauschale Publikumsbashing der etablierten Medien („Trolle“, „Shitstorm“, „digitaler Mob“) gerechtfertigt ist.\n\nUnter den neuen Kommunikationsbedingungen ist alles sichtbar – die kleingeistige Attacke, aber auch die großartige Enthüllung, das berührende Engagement, der verschwörungstheoretische Wahn. Und doch bleibt die Frage: Wie kann sich die fünfte Gewalt – ohne institutionelle Anbindung – gleichsam selbst zivilisieren? Auf welche Weise verhindert man, dass ideologische Parallelrealitäten entstehen, die einer offenen Gesellschaft gefährlich werden können? Und wie bleibt, in einer Zeit radikal individualisierter Nischenöffentlichkeiten, die Agenda der Allgemeinheit als Fixpunkt öffentlicher Debatten gewahrt?\n",

			"abstract": "Alle klinischen Studien müssen ans Licht, um den Nutzen und Schaden medizinischer Maßnahmen abwägen zu können – das findet auch das Europaparlament. Aber gute Argumente und beharrliche Gremienarbeit reichen nicht immer, um diese Transparenz durchzusetzen. Wissenschaftliche Institutionen müssen lernen, auch mal in die Rolle von Aktivisten zu schlüpfen und mit eingängigen Bildern, Witz und Biss für ihre Ziele einzutreten. Die Reputation muss darunter nicht leiden – im Gegenteil!",
			"description": "Es muss viel passieren, bevor eine wissenschaftliche Einrichtung ihre Zurückhaltung aufgibt und ihre Mitarbeiter_innen in die Rollen von Aktivisten schlüpfen lässt. Im Mai 2014 war für uns der Punkt erreicht – mit der #screenonly-Kampagne.\n\nUnser Institut, das IQWiG, erstellt Gutachten zum Nutzen medizinischer Maßnahmen für Patient_innen. Jahrelang hat es auf eine vollständige Veröffentlichung aller klinischen Studiendaten gedrängt: mit Fachveröffentlichungen und wissenschaftlichen Stellungnahmen, in Gremien, auf Tagungen und durch Unterstützung der Petition „All Trials Registered | All Results Reported“. Und die Zeit schien reif für volle Datentransparenz; das hatte eine Verordnung des Europaparlaments gerade gezeigt.\n\nDoch dann drohte eine abrupte Kursänderung der European Medicines Agency (EMA) diesen Fortschritt zunichte zu machen. Es blieben drei Wochen, um die Fachöffentlichkeit zu mobilisieren und die EMA umzustimmen. Fachlich und politisch war schon alles gesagt; gefragt waren neue Wege zur Veranschaulichung unserer Argumente. Heraus kam die Twitter-Kampagne #screenonly, in der Mitarbeiter_innen des Instituts die bizarren Konsequenzen des EMA-Kurswechsels in Fotos und Cartoons darstellten. Diese improvisierte, persönliche Aktion kam gut an und wurde von Multiplikatoren wie dem Arzt und Autor Ben Goldacre dankbar aufgegriffen. Mit Erfolg: Die EMA besann sich und überarbeitete die Zugriffsregeln für ihre neue Studiendatenbank.\n\nIm Vortrag illustrieren wir das Problem der unsichtbaren Studiendaten. Wir zeigen Bilder aus unserer Kampagne. Und wir stellen die nach wie vor offene Frage, wie man komplexe gesundheits- und wissenschaftspolitische Probleme so aufbereiten kann, dass nicht nur Fachleute sie verstehen, sondern auch die Betroffenen – letztlich alle Menschen, in Europa und über die EU hinaus.\n",

			"abstract": "Auf Familienblogs bekommt der Leser oft einen kleinen, privaten Einblick in das Leben des Bloggers. Einige schreiben anonym, zeigen sich, aber keine Fotos ihrer Kinder, auf anderen Blogs wird ein offener Umgang gepflegt.\r\nSind Kinderfotos schon ein Eingriff in die Privatsphäre? Ist ein detaillierter Geburtsbericht zu privat und hat nichts in der Öffentlichkeit verloren? Begünstigen Blogs mit privaten Themen negative Kommentare, Hater oder sogar Stalker? Wo ist die Grenze zwischen sich mitteilen und austauschen und zu privat? Gibt es die überhaupt? Gemeinsam mit drei Familien Bloggerinnen will ich diesen Fragen auf den Grund gehen.",
			"description": "Familienblogs die ihren Schwerpunkt im Redaktionellen sehen, kommen nicht immer umhin, auch private Einblicke zu geben. Schließlich teilen sie Anekdoten aus ihrem Leben, wollen Erfahrungen weiter geben. Wenn Familienblogs für die Blogosphäre so unerheblich wären, würde es nicht über 1600 geben, die allein bei Brigitte Mom registriert sind. Den Leser interessiert es, wie es bei anderen Familien zugeht, wie die Kinder erzogen werden, ob die Wohnung immer aufgeräumt ist und das Leben pädagogisch wertvoll ausgerichtet ist. Zeitschriften, Filme und Werbespots spiegeln längst nicht den Alltag in Familien wider, Verwandschaft ist nicht immer in der Nähe, Freunde sind kinderlos, es fehlt der Austausch. Dabei spielen Familienblogs eine wichtige Rolle.\n\nEs stellt sich jedoch die Frage, wieviel Einblick man dem Leser gewährt. Verfremdet man die Namen der Kinder? Zeigt man sie? Schreibt man nur allgemeingültige Artikel oder polarisiert man vielleicht mit seiner eigenen, subjektiven Erfahrung. Was für den Einen völlig unprivat ist und durchaus ins Netz gehört, stößt beim Anderen auf Unverständnis. Die Beziehung zum Mann, Familienfotos, Geburtsberichte, Krankenheiten der Kinder - ein No-Go oder völlig normale Themen im Familienleben? Viele Blogs, viele Ansichten, viele Erfahrungen.\n\nGemeinsam mit anderen Familienbloggerinnen möchte ich darüber reden, wo die eigene Grenze des Privaten liegt. Warum die Eine Kinderfotos zeigt, die Andere nicht. Ist es allein um sein Kind vor potentiellen Missbrauch der Fotos auf unseriösen Seiten zu schützen? Stellt man sein Kind offensichtlich bloß und erschwert ihm später die Akzeptanz in der Gruppe? Oder sind Medien so ein dominierender Bestandteil im täglichen Familienleben, dass unsere Kinder mit dem öffentlichen Leben später weitaus gelassener umgehen, als wir es vermuten? Auch soll die Frage besprochen werden, ob private Themen erst Recht Angriffsfläche für negative Kommentare, Shitstorms oder sogar Stalker bieten. Oder ob dies eine leidliche Begleiterscheinung der sozialen Netzwerke ist.\n\nWo fängt das Private an? Welche Themen haben im Netz nichts zu suchen? Gibt es überhaupt ein Zu-Privat?\n",

			"title": "Ist Europas digitale Zukunft offen?",
			"abstract": "Die Digitalisierung unseres Alltags nimmt immer stärker zu. Die Auswirkungen des exponentiell wachsenden Fortschritts beschäftigen Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Gefragt sind neue Modelle, welche die Interoperabilität der Applikationen und das Vertrauen der Nutzer sicherstellen.\r\nWir sind überzeugt: Das Geschäftsmodell der Zukunft basiert auf Offenheit und Kollaboration. Die grössten Kinder- und Jugendorganisationen der Schweiz zeigen beispielhaft, wie das digitale Europa der Zukunft aussehen könnte.",
			"description": "Eine Analyse der grössten Kostentreiber bei IT-Projekten der Schweizerischen Bundesverwaltung zeigt: Ein Problem liegt im starken Föderalismus. Was für die Schweiz gilt, lässt sich wohl auch für Deutschland und Europa ableiten: Wie sollen verschiedene Interessen (digital) zusammengeführt werden, wenn jeder zuerst an sich denkt?\n\nGemeinschaftslösungen auf der Basis von Open Source Software vereinen Firmen und Organisationen mit gleichen oder ähnlichen Bedürfnissen. Hinter der freien und quelloffenen Software steht ein professionelles Geschäftsmodell, welches sich an der Idee des Crowdfundings orientiert. Die Kunden bilden eine Community, welche die Lösung finanziert und zusammen mit potenziell mehreren Entwicklerfirmen vorantreibt. Bei der Architektur der Lösung geht es darum, individuelle Bedürfnisse und Eigenständigkeiten zu bewahren, aber auch Kompromisse zum Gelingen eines grossen Ganzen einzugehen. Was ist möglich und wo liegen die Grenzen? Fragen, die sich nicht nur auf Software-Projekte, sondern auch auf das \"Projekt Europa\" beziehen und unsere Zukunft bestimmen werden.\n\nMit hitobito hat Puzzle ITC zusammen mit den grössten Kinder- und Jugendorganisationen der Schweiz eine Open Source Mitgliederverwaltung aufgebaut. Ich möchte euch die Idee von Gemeinschaftslösungen näher bringen und über die Erfahrungen aus den Projekten erzählen. Wir sind zudem laufend auf der Suche nach neuen Organisationen oder Entwickler(-firmen), die unsere Vision von kollaborativer Software-Entwicklung teilen. Ich glaube, dass es auf diesem Weg möglich ist, Open Source Lösungen als Geschäftsmodell in der Wirtschaft und der öffentlichen Verwaltung zu etablieren. Und ich glaube, dass Gemeinschaftslösungen ein Weg sind, um das digitale Europa von morgen zu gestalten.\n\n \n\nPräsentiert von Puzzle. \n",

Auf Hochschulwatch.de untersuchen Transparency International Deutschland, die taz und der fzs, wie Unternehmen damit über Hochschulpolitik und Forschung mitentscheiden und wie sich die Wissenschaft von ihnen abhängig macht.\r\nWir brauchen mehr Transparenz in der Wissenschaft: Deshalb fordern wir eine Veröffentlichungspflichten für Drittmittelverträge von Hochschulen und Unternehmen.",
			"description": "An der TU und HU Berlin hat die Deutsche Bank jahrelang über die Forschung, Lehre und Personalpolitik von zwei Stiftungsprofessuren mitentschieden. Die Uni Köln hat einen Kooperationsvertrag mit Bayer, den sie trotz Klage nicht veröffentlichen will. An der Hochschule Kempten sind Hörsäle nach Sponsoren wie Bosch und Dachser benannt. Die Unternehmen sitzen gleichzeitig im Hochschulrat und entscheiden über die Hochschulpolitik.\n\nAuf unserer Online-Plattform Hochschulwatch.de haben wir in den vergangenen zwei Jahren Beispiele wie diese systematisch zusammengetragen. So haben wir eine große Datenbank über Verflechtungen zwischen Wirtschaft und Wissenschaft in ganz Deutschland aufgebaut, in der wir mehr als 10.000 Verbindungen zwischen Unternehmen und Hochschulen aufzeigen.\n\nDas ist aber nur die Spitze des Eisbergs: Die meisten Daten zu Drittmitteln sind weiterhin nicht öffentlich zugänglich. Dabei sind Unternehmen in allen Hochschulbereichen engagiert: Sie sitzen in Hochschulräten, geben jedes Jahr mehr als 100 Millionen Euro für Stiftungsprofessuren aus, kaufen sich die Namensrechte an Hörsälen und Instituten und veranstalten Einführungstage für Erstsemester an Universitäten.\n\nMit Hochschulwatch haben wir eine Debatte über Einflussnahme von Unternehmen auf Hochschulen angestoßen. Unsere Daten und Recherchen liefern dafür die Grundlage und sollen langfristig zu mehr Transparenz in der Wissenschaft führen. Wir fordern aktive Veröffentlichungspflichten für Drittmittelverträge zwischen Wirtschaft und Wissenschaft, regelmäßige Sponsoringsberichte sowie die Einbindung der Hochschulen in die Informationsfreiheitsgesetze.\n\nWir hoffen, mit dem Projekt Menschen zu ermutigen, uns über kritische Verflechtungen mit der Wirtschaft an ihren Hochschulen zu informieren und das Thema auch vor Ort anzusprechen.\n\nHochschulwatch wird getragen von Transparency International Deutschland, der Tageszeitung taz und dem freien Zusammenschluss von StudentInnenschaften fzs.\n",

			"title": "States think we're stupid: Internet censorship around Europe since ACTA",
			"abstract": "In 2012, we won against ACTA. But did we, really?\r\n\r\nWe criticized ACTA for its corporate censorship provisions. After the overwhelming vote in the EU Parliament, there was hope that the populist reliance on companies to regulate the digital world would be killed once and for good. Since then however, countries have been pushing for more “cooperation with industry” in the absence of human rights safeguards.",
			"description": "This talk gives an overview of online censorship across Europe and an outlook into the future.\n\nThe Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreemeent (ACTA) planned to introduce corporate censorship and to regulate online communications. Since its rejection, many European countries have made moves to launch such measures while failing to provide guarantees for the freedom of expression online. The push for corporate governance of our free speech rights is increasing, despite our victory against ACTA – be it in the name of the fight against alleged copyright infringement, terrorism or child abuse.\n\nToday, in the wake of the attacks in Paris, policy-makers across the EU now call explicitly for measures that violate our online rights. Since 2012, the EU institutions have also been increasingly holding meetings with social media representatives to discuss possible voluntary measures being implemented through the terms and conditions.\n\nIn France, websites are being blocked by ISPs on the demand of administrative authorities without any judicial decision. The country has also stepped up efforts to block or remove online content that is found to violate copyright protections. In addition, the country's ministers have been asking social media services to fight against speech that they deem « inappropriate ».\n\nIn the UK, 11 % of the most popular websites are currently being blocked by at least one of the “voluntary” filters implemented by internet service providers.\n\nIn Germany, the rights-holder industry is actively using Google's contentID system to increase censorship without the need for a court decision which leads to a situation where cultural content is viewable everywhere – except in Germany.\n\nSo what will the future look like when we're considering the development of the Internet of things and generation of more and more data. What does this trend towards increased corporate censorship mean for the automatisation of our households? And how will governments make use of the rise of big data – will they rely more on untransparent algorithms instead of laws?\n",

			"abstract": "Das Aufleben der Handarbeit wird in Medien, die sonst wenig vom Feminismus halten, als dessen „Abgesang“ bezeichnet. Doch was als Kritik an der “Neuen Häuslichkeit” gelabelt wird, ist mal wieder nichts anderes als Abwertung von Weiblichkeit und steht in einer langen Tradition. \r\nKritik darf nicht bei Blümchenmustern ansetzen. Der Mainstream wendet sich gegen einzelne Personen, ihre Vorlieben und ihr Tun, aber nicht gegen gesellschaftliche Systeme, die z.B. dafür verantwortlich sind, dass DIY-Blogs von nicht-Weißen oder nicht-Heteras weniger rezipiert werden. ",
			"description": "Immer mal wieder lassen sich Feuilletons großer Zeitungen oder auch Frauenzeitschriften dazu herab, mit gerümpfter Nase auf auf den “neuen” DIY-Trend zu schauen. Handarbeit sei was für Omas, die nichts anderes gelernt haben, als traditionell weibliche Tätigkeiten - für emanzipierte und moderne Frauen gehöre sich das nicht. Doch was als Kritik an der “Neuen Häuslichkeit” gelabelt wird, ist mal wieder nichts anderes als Abwertung von Weiblichkeit und steht damit selbst in einer langen Tradition. Wer DIY als “Abgesang auf den Feminismus”, sieht, weiß anscheinend nicht, welche Bedeutung diese Bewegung zum Beispiel für die Riot-Grrrls in den 90ern hatte.\n\nDie Kritik an “Neuer Häuslichkeit” wendet sich im Mainstream gegen einzelne Personen, ihre Vorlieben und ihr Tun. Dass Frauen ihre Arbeiten nun in Blogs zeigen, sich darüber austauschen oder gar Geld damit verdienen, wird als negativ bewertete Selbstdarstellung bezeichnet. Hier versteckt sich das sexistische Vorurteil, dass Frauen zurückhaltend sein müssen und nicht selbstbewusst präsentieren dürfen, was sie leisten.\n\nKritik wäre an ganz anderer Stelle angebracht. Bei der Betrachtung von viel gelesenen Handarbeitsblogs fällt auf, wie wenig Diversität dargestellt wird: Aufmerksamkeit bekommen selten Personen, die nicht-weiß oder nicht-hetero sind. Auch DIY-Communitys reproduzieren sich immer weiter selbst und auch im Internet herrschen Diskriminierungsstrukturen.\n\nIm Vortrag soll analysiert werden, welche Möglichkeiten gerade marginalisierte Gruppen durch Handarbeiten und durch die Kombination aus Handarbeit und Internet bekommen. Wie weit hergeholt ist die Befürchtung einer “Neuen Häuslichkeit” und was bedeutet das eigentlich? Welche queer-feministischen Kritikpunkte lassen sich an DIY-Communitys wirklich finden?\n",

			"title": "#AfricaBlogging – Politisches Bloggen in Subsahara-Afrika",
			"abstract": "Africa has the largest growth of internet distribution in the world. With the increasing spread of the internet, social media has become more important in every-day life of African people. In a region where traditional media lacks - due to the absence of infrastructure, corruption, State influence or poor wages – relevant quality for being a real pillar of democracy, social media activists become an increasingly important source of information; they also contribute to the diversity of opinion. ",
			"description": "Political blogs can be an enriching voice within the political dialogue away from traditional media. Given the fact that in many African countries, the media is impeded by governments and therefore not able to report independently, critical political bloggers play a crucial role. This was most apparent in the so called “Arab Spring”, where social media activists were an important source of information for the outside world by having reported promptly and directly of the developments. While they become more and more important within the process of political opinion-making, governments intensify their efforts to intimidate social media activists. A recent example is the detention of the Zone 9 Bloggers from Ethiopia.\n\nIn this session, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung and re:publica provide a forum for political bloggers from Africa. Find out about their concerns, about their issues, the challenges that they are facing und what reactions they provoke with their work in often difficult political environments. Address the question how political blogs can contribute to the diversity of opinion and meet people whose political engagement requires far more courage than in most European countries.\n\nLet’s discuss if African and European experiences in the blogosphere are similar or comparable at all and what we can learn from each other.\n",

Largely unnoticed by most western spectators, Chinese companies have developed innovative digital solutions, providing users with home-grown ecosystems of apps, hardware and services.\n\nChinese netizen create new spaces of identity management, public discourse and civic engagement. These dynamics increasingly shape the pace of global digital innovation.\n\nThe creativity in this vivid community is both hampered and advanced by the Chinese government. Beijing blocks Facebook and Twitter, and progressively censors “sensitive” content on Chinese social media platforms like Weibo or WeChat.\n\nBut Beijing also supports a liquid and fast-moving private IT-sector. Companies like Alibaba start to export their services to other countries, esp. in Asia. This will influence the development of the World Wide Web.  \n\nInternationally, the Chinese government pushes for greater Internet-sovereignty. Microsoft is now forbidden to sell their latest OS (Windows 8) to Chinese government agencies and banks. China’s long pervasive Internet censorship and content regulation now spreads to international platforms as well – LinkedIn serves as one example.\n\nIf the above mentioned developments intensify, Europe may find itself in a position to choose between a Chinese and an American version of the Internet.\n",

			"description": "Onlinewerbung nervt: Layer-Ads überlagern die eigentlichen Inhalte, Banner machen Lärm, schlecht programmierte Animationen bremsen den Rechner aus und nebenbei werden Nutzer auf Schritt und Tritt verfolgt und ihr Verhalten aufgezeichnet.

Auf manchen Seiten sind deutlich mehr als 50 Prozent der Nutzer mit Adblockern unterwegs. Doch die Branche denkt nicht um. Nachrichtenangebote wettern gegen Tracking und werben für Verschlüsselung, lassen aber zu, dass Werbung auf ihren eigenen Websites die Privatsphäre der Nutzer ausspioniert, und bieten auch nach Snowden keinen verschlüsselten Zugriff per HTTPS an.

Welche Vorteile oder Herausforderungen bringt mobiles Bezahlen mit sich? Wie groß sind die Unterschiede in Europa?

			"description": "Nach dem Start von Apple Pay in den USA hat das Thema Mobile Payment wieder an Fahrt gewonnen. Und das obwohl es schon seit Jahren immer mehr Inititativen zum mobilen Bezahlen in Deutschland gegeben hat. Viele davon sind schon früh gescheitert, stecken schon seit Jahren in den Kinderschuhen oder sind am Markt, ohne das es große Nutzerzahlen gibt. Wie sieht aber das Thema Mobile Payment in Europa aus? Wo kann man schon jetzt seinen Alltag fast ohne Bargeld bestreiten und wo liegt Deutschland im Vergleich? Diese Fragen sollen in der Session kurzweilig und gespickt mit eigenen Erfahrungsberichten geklärt werden.\n",

Die große Krux: um an immer mehr zahlende Kunden heranzukommen, werden sogenannte Internet-Kontaktmarkt Schreiber*innen (IKM) angestellt, die mit absichtlich gefälschten Profilen die Kunden bei Laune halten. Auf der re:publica werde ich als Michelle Apate einen Einblick geben hinter die Kulissen der Online-Dating Branche und von meiner Erfahrung als IKM berichten. Es geht um das Stehlen, Kopieren und Spiegeln von realen Identitäten und es geht um das Spielen und Ausnutzen anderer Menschen und ihrer Gefühle.\n\nIKM: Arbeiten in der Grauzone\n\nDoch nicht nur die Nutzer*innen der Online Dating Angebote werden ausgetrickst. IKM ist nach wie vor ein \"Beruf\", der im sehr grauen Bereich ausgeführt wird und nicht immer legal ist. IKM werden z.B. durch ihre Arbeitgeber dazu aufgefordert gefälschte Identitäten zu erstellen und diese später auf ihren Plattformern zu spielen: real erscheinende Personen, mit echten Hobbies, Ausbildungen und Fotos. Die Fotos werden meistens von sozialen Netzwerken und amateur Pornoseiten geklaut und gespiegelt, damit sie von den skeptischen Kunden nicht bei Google Image Search gefunden werden können. Doch damit immer noch nicht genug. Da der gesamte Arbeitsablauf über Browser Applikationen abläuft, kann der Arbeitgeber innerhalb von Sekunden die genaue Performance seiner/ihrer IKM berechnen, in Graphen darstellen und mit dem gesamten Team der IKM teilen. Performance relevante Daten sind z.B. der Kundenkontakt, die durchschnittliche Zeichenanzahl der Antworten an die Kunden, die geschriebenen Emails, die gearbeiteten Stunden, die Neukundenaquise etc. IKM ist also einer der unmoralischsten und gleichzeitig neo-liberalsten Jobs der Welt - jedes gesetzte Zeichen wird gespeichert, gelesen und ausgewertet, ganze Teams werden so unter Druck gesetzt sich selbst zu optimieren im Belügen der Kunden.\n\n \n\nHintergrundinformationen:\n\nIKM auf Wikipedia\n\t\"Die Liebesfalle\", Sendung ARD\n\tSpiegel TV Reportage\n",

Our political institutions greatly influence poorer countries with our policies on migration, trade, the environment or the weapons trade.

Which aren’t? How might we measure & share data about impacts of European policies?",

In the Lisbon Treaty, the EU member states agreed that the EU policy shall not harm the global fight against poverty and the sustainable and equitable development around the world. But the reality is different. National or EU interests often override interests of poor communities elsewhere. Agricultural subsidies harm small scale farmers in Cameroon, weapon exports by EU countries support a repressive regime in Saudi Arabia, CO2 emissions in Germany threaten the survival of small island states in the Pacific. This is why policy makers and civil society organisations alike have called for an index measuring the \"development friendliness\" of the EU and its member states.\n\nAt at re:publica 2015 we want to present to you the Development Barometer - a web app, that that allows individuals to see for themselves how “development-friendly” European policies are.\n\nJoin us as we demo first visualisations of the tool and discuss how we can use data to analyze the impacts of European policies on international development. The Development Barometer tool can be used by anyone, so we encourage people of all kinds to attend: regular citizens, members of civil society organizations, coders, journalists, and policy makers.\n\nJoin us in using data to inform the dialog around European policy.\n",

			"abstract": "Mit jedem Play auf Streaming-Diensten und jedem Like in sozialen Medien werden wir zu gläsernen Musikfans. Diese Daten liefern spannende Erkenntnisse über nerdige Phänomene im Pop – und verändern die Art wie wir Musik kaufen, hören und machen.",
			"description": "Kann's eigentlich sein, dass Bandnamen immer länger werden? Wer kürzlich erzählt hat, dass er auf ein Konzert der „Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs” geht, hat sich diese Frage wohl schon gestellt.Die Antwort lautet allerdings: Nein. Durchschnittlich am längsten waren Künstlernamen Mitte bis Ende der Fünfziger Jahre als sie häufig nach dem Schema „X & The Ys“ funktionierten – wie bei „Van McCoy & The Soul City Symphony Orchestra“ zum Beispiel. Das hat der US-Musikhacker Paul Lamere mit Hilfe der Datenbank von Spotify und ein wenig Code herausgefunden.\n\nDie Datenbanken der Musikstreaming-Anbieter und der sozialen Medien produzieren aber nicht nur spannendes Nerd-Trivia und unnützes Wissen. Sie verfügen über detaillierte Informationen über die Fans der Künstler wie Follower-Zahlen, Wohnort, Alter, Geschlecht und Hörverhalten. Aus diesen Daten lässt sich dann zum Beispiel errechnen, wie leidenschaftlich bestimmte Fans von bestimmten Künstlern sind.\n\nIch habe für das BR-PULS Radio-Feature \"Algorhythm Is A Dancer – Wie Big Data die Musik verändert\" mit Musikhackern, Managern und Vertretern der Musik-Streaming-Dienste über die Auswirkungen von Big Data in der Musik gesprochen. Sie haben mir erzählt, wie die Daten in der Branche unter anderem dazu verwendet werden, Touren zu planen, Singles auszuwählen und Promotion-Strategien zu überwachen.\n\nWie ein Big Data-Projekt über Musik konkret aussehen kann, zeige ich anhand meiner Studie „Wer hat den Größten…? – Deutsche Rapper und ihr Wortschatz“, die im Rahmen des BR-PULS-Features entstanden ist. Dabei habe ich untersucht, welcher deutsche Rapper den größten Wortschatz in seinen Texten verwendet und wie die sprachliche Komplexität mit den Likes der Künstler auf Facebook korreliert. Der Vortrag beleuchtet die Wechselwirkungen zwischen Big Data und dem Verkaufen, Hören und Machen von Musik – und gibt ein Making-Of meines Rap-Wortschatz-Projekts. Algorhythm Is A Dancer now!",

This presentation offers an introduction to the concept of “Critical Technology Education” (CTE) which I have created in my doctoral research as a way to meet the educational demands of the digital society. I argue that we cannot understand central issues in education, such as agency and empowerment, without taking into account the code-based structural affordances. CTE suggests that instead of taking media and technological infrastructures as pre-given external matters, devices that are used or channels that convey information, attention should be shifted to looking at media and technology as active shapers and organisers of our perceptions and thinking.\n\nThe need for Critical Technology Education is argued by presenting results from two case studies of my doctoral research that underline the relevance of CTE. First, I will show what kind of technological future the European Union is drafting for us in their strategy document “A Digital Agenda for Europe” (2010). My analysis concentrates on the technotopian narrative created in the document and the narrow roles of agency offered to citizens. In the second example, I will argue based on a case study on how Facebook users and non-users negotiate their relationship to the platform as a technologically mediated space, that people tend to be indifferent towards how technology is shaping their everyday practices. This is partly due to people taking the automatic data collecting and selling as a normalized part of everyday life.\n\nBoth of these case studies end with the same conclusion: without a better understanding of our technological environment, people are left with few alternatives. To challenge the dominant constructions of agency by administration, technology industry and media, people need new perspectives. Thus, the aim of CTE is to enable members of the digital society to imagine and demand alternatives to what is currently offered to us in the form of different technologies and software-enabled environments, and most importantly, offer chances to regain agency and feel empowered. \n",

			"description": "“Willkommen in der Freien Stadt Berlin, ihr Bürger_innen aus allen 160 deutschen Staaten! Wie jedes Jahr treffen wir uns erneut auf der 'ver:bindung', der größten Konferenz des freien Denkens auf unserem Kontinent. Über siebzig Jahre sind seit dem letzten Krieg vergangen. Das Blutvergießen gehört zum Glück der Vergangenheit an. Doch haben sich andere Feinde unserer Zukunft bemächtigt: Bürokratie, Überwachung und Netzgebühren hindern uns daran, mehr über- und voneinander lernen zu können. Erneut wollen wir hier darüber diskutieren, wie wir diesen Zustand des Friedens endlich auch für die Zukunft stabilisieren können.\n\nDoch bevor wir überhaupt in den Dialog mit unseren liberalen Nachbarn treten können, wie etwa dem Königreich Groß-Groningen – das sogar am freien Internet hängt! –, haben wir noch viel Arbeit vor uns! Wir werden Euch zeigen, welche Nachteile uns dadurch entstehen, dass unsere Regierungen nicht aufhören, gegeneinander zu arbeiten und sich und uns das Leben schwer zu machen. Lasst uns das gemeinsam ändern!”\n\nDamit sind wir mittendrin in unserer alternativen Realität: Die Europäische Union hat nie existiert. Nachdem die französische Revolution brutal niedergeschlagen wurde, wagt auch kein anderes europäisches Bürgertum den Aufbruch und bleibt in seinen alten Strukturen verhaftet. Deutschland sticht dabei als unrühmliches Beispiel hervor – der kleinteiligste Flickenteppich in Europa verharrt in Bürokratie und Überregulierung seiner geschlossenen Netzstrukturen.\n\nWir wagen den fiktiven Protest! Wir wollen zeigen, wie dünn die Schicht der erreichten Freiheit, Gleichheit, Brüderlichkeit ist – und dass sie schnell zerbrechen kann. Unsere alternative Zeitlinie dient dabei als Spiegel unserer Zeit: Unser Vortrag wird ergänzt durch Nachrichten aus sozialen Netzwerken sowie Audio- und Videoelemente. Wir präsentieren Euch eine Gegenwirklichkeit und machen damit die Errungenschaften Europas in unserer “echten” Zeitlinie deutlich. Denn Europa ist es wert, gelebt zu werden!\n",

To become more secure, you must determine what you need to protect, and whom you need to protect it from. Threats can change depending on where you’re located, what you’re doing, and whom you’re working with. Therefore, in order to determine what solutions will be best for you, you should conduct a threat modeling assessment.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about choosing tools, about operational security, and about what you need to think about to protect yourself and your data.\n",

			"abstract": "Die von der Renaissance bis ins 19. Jahrhundert hinein bestehende Tradition der Grand Tour sah vor, dass junge adelige, später auch bürgerliche weiße Männer zur Abrundung ihrer Erziehung eine ausgedehnte, oft mehrjährige Reise durch Frankreich, Italien und die Niederlande unternahmen. Das halbbewusste Sichbewegen im Netz, wie Milliarden Menschen es 2015 auf der ganzen Welt praktizieren, lässt sich – und dies soll im Vortrag geschehen – als zeitgemäße und sozial gerechtere 'Neue Grand Tour' beschreiben.  ",
			"description": "Die Grand Tour oder auch Kavalierreise genannte Unternehmung diente in ihrer klassischen Form der kulturellen Horizonterweiterung, dem Knüpfen von politischen und gesellschaftlichen Beziehungen, dem Verfeinern von Manieren und Kenntnissen und ließ unausgesprochen auch Raum für das Männern vorbehaltene erotische Hörnerabstoßen vor der sozial vorteilhaft gewählten Eheschließung.\n\nAuch bei der Neuen Grand Tour, dem Reisen im Netz, können antike Monumente und Meisterwerke der europäischen Kunst besichtigt, andere Kulturen und Sprachen kennengelernt werden: budget-, klima- und lebenszeitfreundlich. Alle anderen Koordinaten aber haben sich verändert. Unterwegs im Flow lässt sich das neue Prestige Aufmerksamkeit gewinnen; ästhetische, soziale und politische Phänomene können, noch während sie emergieren, beobachtet und mitgeprägt werden. Alles geschieht instantan, ohne dass man sich dafür in der physischen Realität vom Fleck bewegen müsste. Beim Netzreisen verwischen Grenzen, die Vorstellung von Nationalstaaten verliert sukzessive an Plausibilität. Vielleicht ist selbst die Idee Europa schon zu eng geworden für die virtuell Weitreisenden.\n\nChristiane Frohmann unternimmt auf der re:publica mit ihren Zuhörer_innen eine Neue Grand Tour im Zeitraffer, gemeinsam werden verschiedene Gegenden des Netzes bereist. So lässt sich die Alte Welt neu sehen, und vielleicht gelangt man sogar zur vorläufig aktuellsten Form der Neuen Welt. Natürlich bleibt es nicht aus, dass man unterwegs Banditen begegnet. Reisen bildet, aber Reisen birgt auch Gefahren. (Menschen, die den Untergang des Abendlandes fürchten, wird ausdrücklich von der Passage abgeraten.)\n",

			"title": "Including gender, new approaches to privacy and digital security ",
			"abstract": "Over the past years, an increasing attention has been directed to online hate speech, harassment, stalking and death threats launched by non state actors, but also by governments, against women human rights activists and LGTBI people, and their collaborators.  More broadly, misogyny, homophobia and bigotry also intertwine to oppose and silent women engaging into technological fields such as engineering, computing or digital security.  The following discussion will invite different cyberfeminists to exchange about those trends and present current promising initiatives and collective strategies that are confronting and overcoming those issues.",
			"description": "Online hate speech, harassment, stalking and death threats are trapping too many vocal women and LGTBI persons into a contradictory situation where in one hand, as Internet is crucial for their work, in order to coordinate actions or enable a wider reach out, they are also increasingly expose to surveillance and/or punitive actions. All those factors have driven to a situation where Internet is not a safe space and where it is common to see feminist and activist work being deleted, (self)censored, and actively prevented of being seen, heard or read. Logically, those trends diminish the freedom of expression and privacy rights of the people targeted. Tackling those dangers has become higher in the agenda of many feminist and LGTBI organizations and networks and has driven to an active panorama of initiatives, collective strategies and new approaches to privacy and digital security including a gender and cultural diversity perspective. Building upon past events such as the TransHackFeminist convergence, Autonomy (im)possible, Darmstadt delegation, the Feminist Server Summit, Ministry of hacking and the Gender and technology Institute, our invited participants will discuss from a cyberfeminist perspective what is happening online and how we can reclaim and reshape a feminist internet.\n",

			"abstract": "In this session, we want to introduce to existing music hackathon formats, talk about concepts and motivations and encourage musicians, coders and makers to get involved",
			"description": "Hackathons are a common practice today, also in the music sphere. There are several music hackathon formats out there, serving different needs and focussing on different aspects of the wide music spectrum and production process – from the making of music hardware, to remixing music tracks, to hacking software and APIs of larger online/mobile music services, to the coding of new applications supporting music-collaboration and -interaction.\n\nEstablished and globally held music hackathon events have developed specific profiles, such as the Music Tech Fest with a focus on music production, The Musicmakers Hacklab, which is a collaborative workshop culminating in live performances, or Music Hack Days, which are mainly community driven and decentrally organized all over the world.\n\nIn our session, we want to introduce the audience to some of the music hackathon formats out there, talk to the minds behind it and present some outstanding music hacks.\n\nFor those musicians, coders and makers interested to organize their own music hack event, we will provide a meetup at 2PM at the newthinking booth to exchange ideas and to make plans.\n\nThis session is presented by Music Pool Berlin http://musicpoolberlin.net/ and all2gethernow e.V. http://all2gethernow.de/.\n",

			"abstract": "Die rasant voranschreitende Digitalisierung der Kommunikation, der Arbeitsprozesse, der Wirtschaft, unserer gesamten Gesellschaft stoppt brachial an der Grenze zum deutschen Bildungssektor. Hier bestimmen die Erfahrungen der Eltern die Chancen der Kinder, die Digitalisierung eigenständig zu bewältigen. \r\nIm Europäischen Vergleich finden sich deutsche Schüler abgeschlagen. Projekte wie die digitale Staatsbürgerschaft in Estland zeigen, dass ein anderer Umgang mit der Digitalisierung möglich ist. \r\n",
			"description": "Insbesondere im Bereich der Grundschule, aber auch später, versagt das Bildungssystem fast durchgehend bei der Vermittlung von Wissen über und Handlungsbefähigung zum Umgang mit und zur Gestaltung der digitalen Entwicklungen.  \n\nAber nicht nur die Schulen tun sich schwer. Auch die Eltern haben Angst vor der digitalen Welt. Häufig ist die erste Begegnung mit Informationen über die sozialen Medien oder e-Mail die Polizei, die über die Gefahren des Internets aufklärt. Eine frühe Förderung scheitert nicht nur an der Ausstattung der Schulen, viel mehr fehlen auch Konzepte und Lehrer, die mit spielerischen und handlungsorientierten Ansätzen die Grundprinzipien der Programmierung und der Entwicklung von digitalen Projekten unterrichten.\n\nWir präsentieren in unserem Vortrag die Ergebnisse einer Umfrage, die den Zusammenhang zwischen früher Heranführung an Programmiertechniken und Technologie und die spätere Berufswahl untersucht.\n\nFolge der aktuellen Bildungspolitik, aber auch des Mindsets vieler Eltern, ist ein Defizit an Schülern und Schülerinnen, die sich für eine berufliche Ausrichtung in den Bereichen Mathematik, Informatik und Naturwissenschaften entscheiden. Darüber hinaus versperren wir unseren Kindern die gestalterische Teilhabe an der umfassenden Revolution unserer Lebens- und Arbeitsverhältnisse. Die Befähigung mittels der neuen Technologien eigenständig Lösungen zu erarbeiten, Produkte zu bauen, Ideen umzusetzen wird innerhalb der schulischen Ausbildung nicht erarbeitet. Und damit verbauen wir einen Zugang zu einem selbstbestimmten Leben. Ist die Entwicklung alternativlos? Sicher nicht.\n\nWir schauen uns in Europa um nach Projekten, die die Herausforderung Digitalisierung und Bildung fokussieren. Wir freuen uns über Teilnehmer, die selbst Projekte in Deutschland aufsetzen und sind sehr an einer intensiven Vernetzung interessiert.\n",

			"abstract": "Maschinen machen uns nicht arbeitslos, sie werden unsere Chefs. Uns werden dann häufig nur noch die Jobs bleiben, für die sich die Maschinen zu schade oder wir einfach günstiger sind. Es wird Zeit für eine neue, digitale Arbeiterbewegung. ",
			"description": "\n“Automation doesn’t replace labor. It displaces it.” Lilly Irani\n\n\nAuf der rp13 habe ich in meinem Vortrag ‚Das Ende der Arbeit‘ gefragt, ob Maschinen uns unsere Arbeitsplätze weg nehmen. Seitdem ist das Thema auch in der breiten Öffentlichkeit auf die Tagesordnung gerückt. Vor allem aber ist klarer geworden, wie die Veränderung der Arbeitswelt durch den technischen Fortschritt konkret aussieht und wer dabei die Fäden in der Hand hält. \n\n1. Die Datenhausmeister\n\nDurch die Automatisierung und Datendienste ist bereits eine neue Arbeitsform entstanden: „der digitale Hausmeister“. Große Datenunternehmen wie Facebook und Google sind nachwievor auf die Hilfe von Menschen angewiesen, um ihre Datensätze „sauber zu halten“. Bei Facebook z.B. sortieren Menschen ständig die schlimmsten Inhalte aus. Diese Arbeit ist weitgehend unsichtbar, schlecht bezahlt und ohne jegliche Rechte. \n\nDieser Teil greift die Entwicklungen um die technologiebedingte Arbeitslosigkeit auf und zeigt am Beispiel der Datenhausmeister, welche Richtung sie einschlagen.\n\n2. Die Datenbosse\n\nDie sogenannte „Sharing Economy“ verspricht neue Arbeitsplätze und die Möglichkeit für jeden, etwas dazu zu verdienen. Aber wenn hinter einem Dienst wie Uber häufig nur ein Algorithmus verbunden mit einer App steht, bleiben die Rechte und der Schutz der Dienstleister (z.B. Fahrer) auf der Strecke. Wer sich nicht so verhält wie der Algorithmus es für richtig hält, wird abgestraft.  \n\nIn diesem Teil wird die Frage gestellt, wie eine Welt aussehen würde, in der das Arbeitsmodell der „Sharing Economy“ den Arbeitsmarkt ersetzt hat. \n\n3. Eine neue Datenarbeiterbewegung\n\nUber-Fahrer organisieren sich, Crowdworker gründen neue Gewerkschaften, die Neo-Ludditen gewinnen an Aufmerksamkeit. Sie haben verstanden, dass nicht der technologische Fortschritt das Problem ist, sondern die Macht, die sich einige, wenige durch ihn aneignen. \n\nDieser Teil zeigt, dass wir den Entwicklungen nicht hilflos ausgeliefert sind und macht Vorschläge was wir tun können. \n",

			"abstract": "Die EU Code Week ist eine seit 2013 über das Internet koordinierte Graswurzelbewegung, welche tausende Initiativen anregt, innerhalb einer gemeinsamen Woche selbstorganisierte Events zur kreativen Techniknutzung für Kinder und Jugendliche in Europa zu ermöglichen und dabei Open Educational Resources zu generieren. Deutschland war bis letztes Jahr nicht dabei, hat aber mit am meisten Nachholbedarf - Kann die deutsche Code Week und der Code Week Award helfen? ",
			"description": "Von Roboterbau aus Handyschrott und Lego, über elektronische Kleidung und Voodoopuppen, das Erstellen von Outdoor-Apps mit Open Data in hackathons bis hin zum ersten eigenen programmierten Spiel war Deutschland mit spannenden Projekten das erste Mal 2014 vertreten. Die Code Week ist ein beeindruckendes Beispiel für Engagement im digitalen Bildungsbereich. Sie zeigt, dass der kreative Umgang mit Technik nicht nur die Weichen für die Zukunft stellt, sondern auch Spaß macht und das Interesse zahlreicher Kinder und Jugendlicher weckt. Sie zeigt, was allein mit dem Willen motivierter Menschen möglich ist und mittels gemeinsamer Online-Ressourcen, über Grenzen hinweg, voneinander gelernt werden kann. So kann jeder die Zukunft aktiv und kreativ mitgestalten.\n\nUm diese Wirkung nicht nur einmal, sondern mehrfach im Jahr zu erzielen, wurde von der Technologiestiftung Berlin in Kooperation mit dem Design Research Lab und Förderung von Samsung Electronics der „Code Week Award“ Award ins Leben gerufen, welcher mit 5x 5.000€ und 5x 10.000€ insgesamt 10 Projekte zwischen März und September unterstützt.\n\nInnerhalb der Session wird die Code Week in Europa vorgestellt, die Rolle Deutschlands beleuchtet, das kreative Potential von Programmierfähigkeiten ausgelotet und den 10 Gewinner-Projekten des Awards eine Bühne geboten. Die Veranstalter dieser und Prof. Dr. Gesche Joost, Internetbotschafterin Deutschlands in der EU, präsentieren und diskutieren Fragen wie: Welche spannenden Angebote gab es bzw. finden noch statt? Wo kann man selbst aktiv werden? Warum und vor allem Wie sollte man sich mit Code auseinandersetzen?\n\nZusätzlich wird während der Session live eine Voodoopuppe aus leitendem Stoff, einer gehackten Grusskarte und weiteren Elektronikbauteilen gebastelt. Nach dem Motto „Jede Woche ist Code Week!“ kann anschließend selbst in zwei Workshops Hand angelegt werden.\n\n----\n\nTobias Hübner (Lange Coding Nacht am Georgs, Bochum), Juliane Wessalowski (Jugend hackt Süd, Ulm), Christiane Schwinge (Digitale Sandkästen, Hamburg), Daniel Heun (3D Scanner, Darmstadt) Ramin Souleymani (Kreatives Programmieren, Berlin), Antje Moebus (Schmuckprogrammierung, Bremen), Wolf Jeschonnek (Mutant Hero Hacking, Berlin), Stefan Aufenanger (CoKomp, Mainz), Iwan Gabowitch (Einstieg Spiele-Programmierung für junge Frauen, Berlin), Nadine Bergner (Informatik Feriencamp für Weltverbesserer, Aachen)\n",

			"title": "Harnessing the power of social media during election campaigns",
			"abstract": "There has never yet been a time when the Internet and social media are allowing us to share information with millions of people in a matter of seconds. At the same time, there hasn't been a time where it has been equally easy and fast to share false information with such a huge mass of citizens. How is this shaping the world around us? We narrow down our question to analyze the phenomenon of social media on politics. How powerful is the role of social media during an election campaign? Should we fear its misuse or are we about witness a true “democratization” of politics?",
			"description": "It is time to reconsider how social media is changing the playing field in politics and this talk will focus on answering this question in the context of 2014 presidential elections in Romania.\n\nResearch published in the journal Nature showed that important real world behaviors like voting can be influenced by online social networks in an experiment that included 61-million people on Facebook during the U.S. elections in 2010. The authors estimate that Facebook's \"get out the vote\" message yielded more than 300,000 more voters at the polls in 2010. If social media can incentive political participation does it as well have the ability to change the outcome of an election?\n\nBut is this behavior also shared by European users? In 2014 several elections were held across European countries. We look at the ways the online social platforms were used as spaces of political communication by both politicians and the civil society. Our main curiosity was to see if the pattern noticed in the U.S population would be replicated in different European countries.\n\nKeeping a close eye on the November 2014 Romanian presidential elections we noticed something unexpected. A strong social media campaign led by young, urban voters sprang up across several social platforms raising awareness of the importance of going out to vote. And this is where the networks of social media played an exponential effect. Hashtags such as #yeslavot, #alegeri2014 and #diasporavoteaza became the most popular hashtags on Twitter in the days leading up to the election.\n\nThe final result came as a surprise to most political analysts and civic activists alike, so everyone started looking to understand what triggered the dramatic turnaround in popular support for the two candidates.\n\nWhat stroke the civic cord of the Romanian social media users? And learning from the Romanian example has the election playing field changed so that future political campaigns have to change accordingly? Can elections be won over with social media?\n",

These opposing trends are why we ask participants of the workshop to look ahead and imagine the village of the future.

Empathy-oriented interviews can be conducted between participants or with visitors at re:publica. Thereby, we not only create meaningful dialogue, but will also discover solutions that can be applied to working & living in the village of the future.\n\nTogether we will condense these insights and turn them into visions of village life in 2030.

			"abstract": "This session will introduce the start-up Ranking Digital Rights project to the audience of Re:publica. In this ranking, the world’s web and telecommunication companies are measured on how they protect the rights to freedom of expression and privacy of their users. RDR finished two years of research and development, and will conduct its first public ranking this year. We will invite the audience to weigh in on what’s most important to them in protecting their free expression and privacy rights.",
			"description": "In this session, we hope to acquaint a wider audience with Ranking Digital Rights in advance the launch of our inaugural company ranking in Fall 2015. \n\nThe Ranking Digital Rights project (RDR---rankingdigitalrights.org) targets a troubling problem with serious implications for the future of freedom and democracy worldwide: Rapid escalation of digital surveillance and censorship via the products and services of information and communications technology (ICT) sector companies. This in turn makes it increasingly difficult for activists, political opposition groups, whistleblowers, and journalists to use the Internet safely or effectively.   RDR has developed a methodology to rank ICT companies on free expression and privacy criteria. A key goal is to better incentivize and benchmark companies’ respect for and protection of user rights, as well as to better inform global company-focused advocacy around the right to free expression and privacy. By May 2015 RDR will have completed a pilot study focused on Internet and telecommunications companies and we will have published the full list of companies that will be publicly ranked in 2015.\n\nIn introducing RDR we will also introduce the broader framework of principles and guidelines for business and human rights, upon which RDR has built concrete standards for measuring ICT sector companies’ policies and practices. We will present Ranking Digital Rights as an innovative approach to producing a concrete tool for companies to understand how they can improve practices to meet their human rights obligations, for civil society to build concrete advocacy strategies based on comparative data, for responsible investors to set clear criteria, and for policymakers to better understand how specific laws and regulations affect companies’ ability to respect human rights.\n\nWe will be especially interested in getting the audience’s feedback on what they experience to be critical in defending their free expression and privacy rights when using online and mobile services.\n",

			"title": "From Singularity to Polysingularity: Evolutionary Approach",
			"abstract": "Evolution is based on adaptability, but the coming Singularity – when everything becomes connected to everything else – will reduce diversity, and, thus, decrease evolutionary potential. In this talk I introduce a modified notion of Singularity - Polysingularity – which embraces variability, diversity and irrationality. I propose various practical applications, ranging from creating divinatory recommender systems to cognitive psychosomatic practices to exemplify this approach.",
			"description": "Evolution proceeds through adaptation. Human beings are some of the most adaptable creatures on earth mainly because both our bodies and brains have various adaptation mechanisms hardwired into them. Those mechanisms emerged as a response to our environment, however, as the humanity is racing towards Singularity, we're starting to gradually delegate those adaptive mechanisms to the \"cloud\". \n\nBut who operates the cloud and, more importantly, how? A few big monopolies who have to generate profit for their shareholders. They are concerned with growth, which is not the same thing as evolution. They dilute our capacity to be more adaptable by numbing our senses with algorithms and recommender systems, which reduce variability of our incoming data flows. The new \"cloud\" is being constructed based on the wrong principles.  Those who proclaim the coming of Singularity, proclaim the new world, which will be based on the islands of sameness linked by the toll-charge bridges run by the big corporations.\n\nHowever, there is a different way. We need to introduce more variability practices into the \"cloud\", to make it more human. We already have a lot of software that's very logical and rational, we now need to build software that is irrational. We need recommender systems that offer us something that none of our friends know, to spur innovation. We need social networks that would push to our newsfeed the posts of the people that we don't like. We need ten different search engines that all find different things and in ten different ways, but not one.  This way we will maintain diversity and ensure that the capacity to adapt in hard-wired into the new cyberhumany we are creating.\n\nThe coming Singularity will then become Polysingularity: an interconnected network of internally diverse multiplicities, which maintain their specificity and yet interact on the global level. A kind of digital Europe minus the utopia of everybody becoming the same.\n\n \n",

Es tobt ein Streit über die Zukunft des digitalen Musikgeschäfts - und darüber, wie Künstler künftig noch von ihrer Musik leben können. Wie lässt sich der Konflikt lösen? ",
			"description": "Streaming wird zum Massengeschäft: Immer mehr Musikfans bevorzugen Abo-Modelle, statt die Musik zu kaufen und dauerhaft auf Computern, Smartphones oder Tablets zu speichern. Werbefinanziert oder gegen eine Monatsgebühr rufen sie ihre Lieblingstitel aus dem Netz ab, wann und wo es ihnen passt. Für die Musiker springen dabei nicht mehr Anteile am Verkaufserlös heraus, sondern Cent-Bruchteile pro Abruf. In der Branche herrscht deshalb Streit: Viele Musiker, auch prominente Interpreten wie Taylor Swift, wehren sich gegen diesen Trend, weil sie deutlich geringere Einnahmen befürchten. Die Streaminganbieter weisen diese Kritik zurück, verweisen auf Millionensummen, die sie an Künstler überweisen. Ist das Streaming also die Zukunft oder das Ende digitaler Musik?\n\nWir bringen Anbieter, Künstler und Vertreter der Musikindustrie gemeinsam aufs Podium, um mit ihnen zu diskutieren: Welche Lösungen gibt es für den Streaming-Streit? Wie können Künstler und Anbieter besser zusammenarbeiten? Wie sieht die digitale Zukunft der Musikbranche aus?\n",

Explore how digital communication is accelerating the way chefs, avid foodies, and ultimately industries discover tomorrow's flavors.  Participate in an experiment using data to prototype a new flavor sensation.",
			"description": "From the food trucks of Los Angeles to the matcha cookies at Markthalle Neun, most of the key food trends in the last 15 years have spread through independent innovators rather than the food industry – as was the case for most of the 20th century. Whereas sliced bread and TV dinners were cooked up by industry R&D and marketing, today’s ramen grilled cheese, kale chips, cronuts are created by young entrepreneurs who tune into global/local inspiration and shoot from the hip.\n\nWith a global explosion of food blogs, over 13M posts tagged #foodie on Instagram alone, and the fact that 44% of American millenials say they have posted a photo of food or drinks that they or someone else were having on social media, today’s glut of food trends travel fast.  What’s more, these trends are traversing global borders more frequently and flexibly, even challenging some of the most ingrained gastronomical traditions (vegans in the land of Würstchen, anyone?).\n\nIn this workshop, we'll explore several prominent food trends, probe their origins and evolution, and understand the roles that chefs, emerging media, foodie enthuisasts, and the industry play in driving propagation.  We'll consider how food trendspotting has evolved, with millions of tweets, pix, reviews, food blogs, Pinterest recipe boards, etc providing a wealth of data to an industry increasingly challenged to keep ahead of our changing tastes. We will also experiment with data-combing tools like Yelp Food Trends and IBM's Chef Watson to explore rapid hybridization in action, developing a new dish for participants to sample.\n",

			"description": "Discussions on how to secure citizens’ digital rights (i.e., rights of privacy and online freedom of expression) are by now key features of the global debate on the governance of the internet. In the fast moving debate, where “old” governmental powers clash with corporate players and new actors gaining in influence, we are witnessing a significant increase in the number of European-led actions and initiatives. Specifically, the EU puts a pronounced emphasis on internet governance in its “digital agenda”. As a result, the European parliament, the European Commission and other institutions are increasingly seen as an emerging actor in this policy field.\n\nThe increased international engagement of EU institutions calls for expanding our understanding of the role Europe plays in the international internet governance debate, and why it matters, if at all. Moreover, the question of whether a consistent and unitary European internet governance agenda is possible, remains. Given the complexity of internal decision making structures, and the politicised and cross-cutting character of internet governance, the EU is not short on challenges. It will grapples with these in order to enhance its legitimacy and produce tangible outcomes that may be translated into rights-based deliverables.\n\nThe panel scrutinises the role of the EU in international negotiations over internet governance, with an emphasis on two issues: cyber security and, data protection/privacy. Particularly, the focus will be on exploring tangible outcomes so far obtained by EU initiatives, as well as future perspectives, while addressing the major obstacles that EU institutions will face in order to enhance their legitimacy and to lead a consistent agenda.\n\nThe panel will answer the following key questions:\n\nWhere do we find Europe in the fast developing global internet governance;\n\tHow are contentious internet governance issues reflected in the EU agenda?\n\tHow does the European internet governance agenda differ from those of other actors?\nBy tackling these overarching questions, a significant cross-cut of which unfolds on the Internet Policy Review, this panel will make an insightful contribution to whether a EU-specific understanding of internet governance exists, and expand our understanding of the EU in the world by providing novel inputs on a potent topic with long-term implications.\n",

			"abstract": "Lügenpresse, Misstrauen, Parallelwelten wie Pegida: Was hat das Internet damit zu tun? Und vor allem: Wie machen wir es besser?",
			"description": "In Europa wächst ein Problem heran. Ein Teil der Bevölkerung fühlt sich von den Eliten nicht mehr ernstgenommen, von den „Berufspolitikern“ sogar betrogen und von der vermeintlichen „Lügenpresse“ manipuliert. Diese Bürgerinnen und Bürger suchen simple Erklärungen für ihren Unmut und einen Sündenbock, dem sie die Schuld zuweisen können.\n\nErnüchternd ist dabei die Rolle des Internets. Dieses Tool, das doch die Demokratie stärken sollte, hilft ausgerechnet radikalen Gruppen, die an Argumenten gar nicht interessiert sind und nur Ressentiments schüren wollen, das zeigte zum Beispiel Pegida.\n\nDas Kernproblem ist: Radikale Stimmen haben es im Netz wesentlich einfacher, Verbreitung zu finden.\n\nDas hat menschliche und technische Gründe. Radikale (und gefrustete) Gruppen haben ein stärkeres Mitteilungsbedürfnis, sie bringen ihr Anliegen pointierter auf den Punkt und weisen ein oft manisches Postingverhalten auf. Sie jubeln Gleichdenkenden zu und mobben Andersdenkende weg. \n\nDieses Verhalten wird durch die Architektur vieler Webseiten sogar belohnt. Viele Webseiten sind von einer binären Logik geprägt – entweder ich teile einen Beitrag oder ich teile ihn nicht; entweder ich like etwas oder nicht. In einem solchen binären Setting erhalten angriffige Meinungen mehr Aufmerksamkeit. Das zeigt auch eine Studie von Daegon Cho und Alessandro Acquisti.\n\nWir müssen wegkommen von dieser Diskussionskultur, bei der die Eskalation fast schon vorprogrammiert ist.\n\nNur wie kann dies gelingen? Auch bei der Lösung des Problems spielt das Netz eine zentrale Rolle. Phänomene wie Pegida entstehen beispielsweise nicht über Nacht, eine solche Stimmung gärt länger – auch in den sozialen Medien – heran. Das Internet kann als Frühwarnsystem dienen, um die Risse in der Gesellschaft rechtzeitig zu erkennen.\n\nDie Situation ist ernüchternd, aber nicht irreparabel. Im Kern soll Mut gemacht werden: Dass wir das Netz als jenes demokratisches Tool verteidigen können, als das es gedacht war.\n",

			"title": "(K)Ein Tor zur Inklusion?  Die Bedeutung Sozialer Medien für erwerbslose Digital Natives in Europa ",
			"abstract": "Die Nutzung von Social Media ist zentraler Alltagsbestandteil vieler Erwachsener in ganz Europa. Vor dem Hintergrund zunehmender Arbeitslosigkeit und sich daraus ergebender prekärer Lebenslagen stellt sich die Frage, welches mögliche Potenzial in dieser Medienform, insbesondere für Digital Natives, liegt. Dabei sind euphorische Vorstellungen der Nutzungschancen häufig viel zu übertrieben und müssen relativiert werden. Dennoch ist es zugleich wichtig, die Bedeutung von Social Media als alternative Strukturierer des Alltags, als kostengünstige Austausch-, Informations- und Bildungsplätze sowie als Freizeitangebot im Kontext von Erwerbslosigkeit zu verstehen.",
			"description": "Ohne Arbeit zu sein bedeutet weit mehr als die tägliche Konfrontation mit finanziellen Engpässen:  Das Gefühl erwerbslos und damit sozial isoliert und ausgegrenzt zu sein, führt bei Betroffenen oftmals zu schwerwiegenden psychischen Erkrankungen, wie beispielsweise zu Depression oder Angstzuständen. Dass dabei besonders soziale Kontakte und der Austausch mit ihnen zur Reduktion dieses psychischen Stresses dienen ist in der Erwerbslosenforschung vielfach dokumentiert. Allerdings reduziert sich mit dem Verlust des Arbeitsplatzes auch der Austausch mit anderen, da wesentliche Bezugsgruppen - nämlich das gesamte Kollegen- und Arbeitsumfeld - schlagartig wegfallen. Social Media, die gerade das Knüpfen und Aufrechterhalten von Kontakten als Nutzungsziel haben, bieten daher, zumindest theoretisch betrachtet, ein erhebliches Potenzial die negativen sozialen und psychischen Folgen von Erwerbslosigkeit zu reduzieren. \n\nLeider existieren bisher keine bzw. kaum Studien zum Nutzungsverhalten oder Chancen und Risiken von Social Media im Kontext der Erwerbslosigkeit. Nach wie vor wird zwar der Medienkonsum, allerdings meist in Form von TV, als zentraler Füller und Gestalter der unfreiwilligen „Frei“-Zeit von Arbeitslosen gesehen und dementsprechend thematisiert. Ergebnisse solcher Studien sind jedoch im digitalen Zeitalter extrem veraltet, da jegliche Interaktivität nicht berücksichtigt ist - doch genau diese zeichnet sowohl den Medienkonsum als auch die Kommunikation in Social Media aus.\n\nAusgehend von empirischen Daten zeigt ein Blick in die Nutzungsrealität Erwerbsloser in Deutschland jedoch einen differenzierten Befund: Für viele Erwerbslose spielen Social Media und die Debatten über deren Chancen und Risiken ohnehin keine Rolle. Sie haben nämlich derzeit überhaupt gar keinen Zugang zum Internet und damit auch nicht zu anderen Internetanwendungen. Für Digital Natives stellt sich die Nutzung von Social Media hingegen als zweiseitige Medaille dar: Einerseits bieten sie den jungen Erwachsenen in ihrer prekären Lage kostengünstigen Zugang zu Unterstützung und Hilfestellungen - vor allem im Austausch mit anderen Betroffenen und Freunden, aber auch durch gezielte Ablenkungen. Andererseits hat dies gleichzeitig zur Folge, dass sich Erwerbslose mit eine Vielzahl anderer Nutzer bzw. mit deren Selbstdarstellungen in digitalen Netzwerken vergleichen (müssen). Daraus entsteht oftmals die Wahrnehmung - stärker noch als bei Offline-Beziehungen - aufgrund der Erwerbslosigkeit gesellschaftlich ausgeschlossen und nutzlos zu sein. Andere Erwerbslose, die zwischen diesen beiden Extrempolen der Nutzung bzw. Nichtnutzung liegen, variieren hinsichtlich ihrer Fähigkeiten, der Ausstattung mit Endgeräten, der Motive ihrer Nutzung sowie der Erfahrungen im Umgang mit Social Media. In anderen Ländern Europas, in denen die Arbeitslosigkeit einen wesentlich größeren Anteil der Bevölkerung betrifft (z.B. 26% in Griechenland oder 23% in Spanien) existieren diesbezüglich keinerlei empirische Daten. Anhand genereller Nutzungsstatistiken kann jedoch gezeigt werden, welches Potential in Social Media für Digital Natives in Europa liegt.\n",

			"abstract": "Fine young humanists from \"Haus Bartleby - Centre for Career Refusal\" expound the thesis, that we have to quit dependent employments to leave the false narratives of economic growth and the myths of \"creativity\". The Berlin based advocatory research group gives instructions to overcome the \"Epoch of Austerity\" in which the first aim of capitalists was to push individuals to set in platforms disrupting traditional markets and individual income. \"We would prefer not to.\" And we can.\r\n\r\nWhich will to be proven!",
			"description": "\n\"Nothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance.\" - Bartleby by Herman Melville\n\n\n\"Haus Bartleby - Centre for Career Refusal\" is a free advocatory lobby of journalists, scientists and writers in Berlin. All of the members shortly ceased cooperation with capitalism for the well-known reasons. The Bartlebysts now work and publish together for the new approach towards economy, ecology and ethics at the turning point of the Epoch of Austerity.\n\n\n\"Plan B.\" - Johnny Haeusler\n\n\nAs a first step, the founders provoke to question dependent employment for a new understanding of capitalist structures. As privileged young high potentials we all seem prone to apply for the money of old men, legitimated by anybody, to realise our smart ideas. But developments of the past few years show that the disruption of traditional markets by new centrally coordinated expert groups and platforms exaggerate the beauty of social networks, turning the internet into a vicous tool for a new internet oligarchy to come. Ideas often are perverted into the opposite of its intentions.\n\nWhat once began as an utopia of a common future in the internet is at the crucial point, threatening to tip over into a perverted capitalist dystopia, accelarating the accelaration.\n\nHow can we step out the dependecies that keep us in the rat race that suits mankind less and less? Ladies and Gentlemen. We have some instructions for you.\n\nThe foundation of Haus Bartleby has been palpable by establishing the hausbartly.org website and the first lobby bureau in Berlin, opened to the public in late 2014. Founders are Alix Faßmann, journalist and former advisor for the German Social Democrats' Party, Jörg Petzold, radio maker and expert for contemporary literature and Anselm Lenz, worker, journalist, theatre dramaturg and author.\n\n\n\"The exquisite art of idleness, one of the most important things that any University can teach.\" - Oscar Wilde\n\n",

			"title": "What democratic deficit? – How comments on the Eurocrisis help construct a European society!",
			"abstract": "For years the EU has been critiqued for its democratic deficit. As a reaction, in the early 2000nds the EU Commission hailed the internet as the solution for more participation and legitimation. I am going to argue that such a top-down endeavour was doomed to fail. Still, political communication about the EU is happening online and it serves democratic ends. But it is not necessarily happening where and how people wanted it to happen. ",
			"description": "It is safe to say that the EU Commission did not succeed in engaging European citizens on a large scale in political decision making processes, when they introduced the Debate Europe and later the Futurum online forum. Especially online communication with its potential to enable communication across borders was deemed relevant for a European public sphere, an informed European citizenry and a legitimate European Union. But EU officials missed to recognize that offering possibilities for communication does not automatically lead to people actually using them. Nevertheless, drawing on data from a 12-year long research project, I am going to argue that political online communication about the EU is happening online. But it might not be happening where and how officials and democratic theorists wanted it to happen. Based on my analysis of hyperlink networks and analysis of online interactions in comment forums in six European countries (AT, DK, F, GER, PL, UK) I am going to show that the current crisis triggered people’s engagement with Europe, both online and offline. Although we cannot speak of direct attributions of legitimation to the EU, Europe is becoming embedded in citizens’ everyday political talk online. Despite its national segmentation on a structural level, I am going to conclude that in people’s online communication we can still see transnational spaces of communication emerging which contribute to the constitution of Europe as a social space. \n",

Was klappt gut, was ist schwierig?\n\nLaut KIM-Studie kennen 94% der Kinder Google. Suchmaschinen speziell für Kinder kennen ungefähr die Hälfte der 6- bis 13-Jährigen. Deren Ziel ist es, Kinder an die Nutzung von Suchmaschinen heranzuführen und ihnen das Internet in einem sicheren Umfeld zu zeigen. Internetseiten extra für Kinder werden hier leichter aufgefunden, sodass Kinder ihre Fragen zielgruppengerecht beantwortet bekommen. Sollen Kinder ihre Lieblingsseiten nennen, landen die Kindersuchmaschinen www.fragFINN.de und www.blinde-kuh.de gleichauf mit Google.\n\nDie Informationssuche im Internet ist die häufigste Tätigkeit von Kindern im Netz – sie suchen hier v.a. für Schule und Hausaufgaben, aber auch nach Spielen, Prominenten, ihren Lieblingstieren oder aktuellen Nachrichten. Dabei nutzen sie am häufigsten Suchmaschinen für Erwachsene aufgrund größerer Bekanntheit.\n\nWir wollen im Direktvergleich herausfinden, welche Suchmaschine am besten die Ergebnisse liefert, die gesucht werden. Welche Funktionen brauchen Kinder wirklich, mit welchen Problemen werden sie bei ihrer Recherche mit Erwachsenen- und Kindersuchmaschinen konfrontiert und welche Wünsche haben sie an Google und Co.?\n\nModeratoren und das Publikum begleiten die Kinder auf der Bühne, stellen Fragen, haken nach. Seid dabei beim Praxistest der Suchmaschinen von Erwachsenen versus Kinder!\n\nHintergrund: Seit Sommer 2012 sind mittlerweile fünf Mädchen und drei Jungen als Kinderreporter für fragFINN.de tätig.

			"description": "HELLO? MADAGASKAR? CAN YOU HEAR US? A group of students from the University for Applied Science Berlin tested during one semester a unique form of teaching, learning and co-creating between the northern and southern hemisphere. 15 Berlin-based and 10 Antananarivo-based business, IT and engineering students used online tools to co-create new products and services within the realm of 'Internet of Things'. The process of work was shaped by design thinking. The combination between tech, business and design mindsets, merged with digital collaboration tools and intercultural frictions, revealed important insights not only about the future of education but also about how creative collaboration in digital international teams works.\n\nMOOCs* are dead. Long live the SPOCs**!\n\nThis Malagasy-German University project resulted from re:publica's Global Innovation Gathering (GIG). We wondered how might we assure a lean, unbureaucratic and simple knowledge transfer between African Tech Hubs and European Universities. Internet and Communication Technology (ICT) would help us overcome space and time limitations, make skills and knowledge easily accessible, international collaboration possible and would eventually foster global collaboration and IoT innovations.\n\nSo we invited the Malagasy Innovation HUB Habaka to join our course about 'Design Thinking and Internet of Things' and designed a so-called SPOC (Small Private Online Course).\n\nWhile teaching creativity and design methods in the 'analogue' classroom already is quite a challenging task, adopting digital tools and building trust between the two hemispheres showed clear limitations. \n\nIt was clear that ICT based collaboration can hardly substitute human-to-human interaction necessary for trust-building, or human-to-product interactions crucial to ideating, physical prototyping and testing.\n\nBut technology does break political, social and geographic boundaries and gives participants a massive feeling of FREEDOM. Everything you imagine is possible once you have reached a level of systemic interconnected thinking with your collaborators and you start employing same empathy to digital collaborators as to offline collaborators.\n\n*Massive Open Online Courses **Small Private Online Courses\n",

			"description": "Bereits seit den 1980ern nutzen Nazis und andere rechte Gruppen das Netz für Hetze, Mobilisierung und Rekrutierung. Mit der Mainstreamisierung der Sozialen Netzwerke in den letzten Jahren hat sich das Problem verschärft, da organisierte Nazis mit anderen gesellschaftlichen Gruppen, die der Kameradschaftsszene bisher eher fremd waren, besser, leichter und effektiver in Kontakt kommen.\n\nDie Schlagkraft der HoGeSa- und Pegida-Demonstrationen der letzten Monate ist ein erster Ausbruch dieser Entwicklungen. Beobachten können wir hierbei auch Vernetzungseffekte in ganz Europa. Pegida mutiert zu einem Exportschlager in Europa. Zumindest im Netz.\n\nDie Amadeu Antonio Stiftung beobachtet seit Jahren rechte Vernetzung und Agitation im Netz und hat mit Netz-gegen-Nazis.de, Fussball-gegen-Nazis.de und No-nazi.net Projekte geschaffen, die ein umfangreiches Bild dessen zeichnen können, was im Netz passiert.

Dutzende Apps, Programme, Websites plus ein wenig Hardware (Smartphone, Tablet, WLAN-Radio, Computer, NAS). Problem: Diese Dinge reden nicht miteinander. Walled Gardens überall, APIs Mangelware, Metadaten Kraut und Rüben, Artwork ...vielleicht mal googlen.\n\nUnd erst die Oberflächen: Immernoch mit dem guten alten Charme und der Sexyness einer Tabellenkalkulation. Sieht so Liebe zu Musik aus? Sollte man diesen Leuten die UI von Musik überlassen? Klar ist: In nächster Zeit entscheidet sich, wie wir künftig mit Musik umgehen werden.\n\nIch glaube, es braucht eine offene Infrastruktur, eine Art Open Source Betriebssystem oder wenigstens einen Browser für Musik. Woher kann das kommen, was passiert bereits, aber vor allem: was muss es leisten? Diese Dinge würde ich gerne aus UX-Sicht gemeinsam eruieren, analysieren, diskutieren\n",

			"title": "Öffentlich-rechtliche Medien als digitales Paradies – eine Halluzination!",
			"abstract": "Wir berichten live und in Echtzeit aus dem Jahr 2020. Der Journalismus ist verschwunden. Facebook hat Netz und Medien komplett kolonialisiert. Und jetzt? Nur die öffentlich-rechtlichen Medien bleiben über. Sie sind sogar cool. Das geht nicht? Klar geht das! Hier lang! Seit zehn Jahren arbeiten Lydia Meyer und Markus Heidmeier für öffentlich-rechtliche Medien – als Redakteur_in, Autor_in, Strategieberater_in. Sie performen ihre 10 Thesen aus der Zukunft der öffentlich-rechtlichen Medien, diskutieren sie mit dem Publikum diskutieren, sammeln neue Thesen ein und verabschieden sie dann als Ad-Hoc Manifest von der rp15. ",
			"description": "THESEN: \n\n1    Verfügbarkeit der Inhalte: Alle öffentlich-rechtlich produzierten Inhalte gibt es in einem digitalen und onlinebasierten sogenannten D-Player. Öffentlich-rechtliche Inhalte sind überall und zeitlich unbegrenzt verfügbar. Rechtliche Fragen wie Autoren- und Mitwirkendenverträge müssen gelöst werden. Archive sind zudem öffentlich.\n\n2    Medienpolitik: Partizipation ist Realität, Dialog Alltag. Die Kontrollgremien werden öffentlich gewählt. Jeder Wahlberechtigte kann Mitglied eines Kontrollgremiums werden. \n\n3    Verantwortung für Innovation: Öffentlich-rechtliche Medien tragen gerade mit Blick auf den technologischen Fortschritt und ihre Sonderstellung im Medienwettbewerb eine besondere Verantwortung für die Weiterentwicklung der publizistischen Innovation. Diese publizistische-technische Innovation wird Teil ihres staatsvertraglichen Auftrags. Darüber hinaus fließen 25% aller Gebührenmittel in einen Innovationspool. Mittel aus diesem Innovationspool sind für alle zugänglich. Ein Board aus Vertretern der Rundfunkanstalten und der Kontrollgremien vergeben die Mittel vierteljährlich. \n\n4    Grundversorgung 1: Grundversorgung muss alle Menschen erreichen ist plattformunabhängig. Aufgrund technischer Innovationen (Digitalisierung, Onlinekommunikation) einerseits und sinkenden Marktzugangsschwellen für Dritte werden die linearen Angebote der Rundfunkanstalten für Radio und Fernsehen um ca. 50 % reduziert. 25 % der frei werdenden Mittel werden für Innovation durch Dritte zur Verfügung gestellt. Weitere 25 % der Mittel setzen die Rundfunkanstalten für die Entwicklung und Distribution von Inhalten auf nicht linearen elektrischen Kanälen ein. \n\n5    Grundversorgung 2: Grundversorgung bedeutet aber auch, dass öffentlich-rechtliche Medien ihre Korrespondenznetze und Produktionsstrukturen für Dritte bereitstellen.\n\n6    Grundversorgung 3: Öffentlich-rechtliche Medien fordern und benötigen Netzneutralität! Sie sind aber auch kostenfrei für Nutzer über Mobilfunknetze verfügbar. Hierzu handeln die Rundfunkanbieter Verbreitungsverträge mit deutschen Providern aus.\n\n7    Erfolgskriterien: Für Rundfunkanbieter, Programme und Sendungen werden fortlaufend Erfolgskriterien entwickelt. Diese Erfolgskriterien sind nicht nur quantitativer Art, sondern auch qualitativer Art. Die Erfolgskriterien sind öffentlich. Sie werden fortlaufend evaluiert (siehe Medienforschung). \n\n8    Bildungsauftrag: Öffentlich-rechtlichen Medien gehen ihrem Bildungsauftrag nach. Inhalte werden explizit in Kooperation mit Bildungsinstitutionen entwickelt. Neben der Entwicklung expliziter Inhalte und Verbreitungswege für Bildungsinstitutionen schaffen die Rundfunkanbieter  eigenen Bildungsangebote auf Basis eigener Inhalte (z.B. MOOCs etc.). Auch die Vermittlung von Medienkompetenz ist Teil des staatsvertraglichen Auftrags. \n\n9    Medienforschung ist ein permanenter öffentlicher Prozess. Quantitativer Erfolg ist immer nur ein Teil des staatsvertraglichen Auftrags (siehe oben). Medienforschung hat immer das Ziel Nutzer in den Mittelpunkt zustellen. Das heißt nicht, dass ausschließlich quantitativ erfolgreiche Sendungen weiterentwickelt werden.  \n\n10    Die Haushaltsabgabe ist einkommensabhängig.\n\n \n\n \n",

			"description": "The idea for the session started with deliberations about different online music platforms that musicians and DJs use to upload their new tracks, songs and mixes – like Soundcloud, Mixcloud, Hearthis.at or Bandcamp. How are e.g. rights management and business models organized differently, what are the interests behind certain developments, and how sustainable are these services in the long run? (see e.g. a conversation with Walter Marinelli (Blogrebellen, Music Pool Berlin) as a background: https://soundcloud.com/rebootfm/sparkfm-39)\n\nThis leads to some more general thoughts about digital infrastructures and digital technologies that we use for all kinds of purposes, also beyond music. And we continue the conversation with Marcell Mars, who is currently working on his PhD an the Digital Cultures Research Lab at Leuphana University in Lüneburg.\n\nThis session takes a broader look at what kind of technology is being developed nowadays – within the prevailing start-up culture and business structures. If a few large tech giants outsource research and development to the enthusiastic gambler, the entrepreneur – how does that system influence design, business practice and functionality of technology? In the popularity contest of the start-ups, which functionalities do the entrepreneurs prioritize – network effects, data collection, functional user problems ..? Or do these go hand in hand? Which interests play a part in tech and digital service development?\n\nThis session is presented by Music Pool Berlin http://musicpoolberlin.net/ and all2gethernow e.V. http://all2gethernow.de/.\n",

And so the South2South Manifesto was born: #s2smanifesto.\r\n\r\nFrom data journalism to drones to crowd sourcing, join DW Akademie and South2South innovators to explore how digital technologies are strengthening freedom of expression in their home countries.\r\n",
			"description": "In vielen Entwicklung- und Schwellenländern hat sich in den letzten Jahren eine lebendige NGO-  und Technologie-Szene entwickelt, die auf das Internet setzt, um für mehr Meinungsfreiheit zu kämpfen und den Zugang zu Information im globalen Süden zu verbessern.

Und was kann man –  auch im Norden – aus den praktischen Erfahrungen in Ländern wie Bangladesch, Kambodscha, Argentinien, Guatemala, Ägypten, Palästina oder Kenia lernen? Die DW Akademie, das Medienentwicklungszentrum der Deutschen Welle, organisierte Ende 2014 dazu den \"South2South\"-Mediendialog in Kapstadt. Medienexperten und Digitalaktivisten aus 14 verschiedenen Ländern präsentierten ihre vor und erarbeiteten Prinzipien für die innovative Nutzung digitaler Technologien. Sie alle hatten eines gemeinsam: die Überzeugung, dass das Internet und neuen Technologien auch in Ländern des Südens eine Chance darstellt, um verkrustete Mediensysteme aufzubrechen und in ihren Ländern die Meinungsfreiheit zu stärken. Die Expertise der Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer reichte von Crowdsourcing, investigativen Recherchemethoden, Hyperlokal-Journalismus bis hin zu Datenvisualisierungen und Open-Data Projekten. Am Ende des intensiven Austauschs stand ein gemeinsames \"Manifest\", das sieben Grundregeln für die erfolgreiche Umsetzung von neuen Ideen beschreibt: Strategy, Integration, Sustainability, Openness, Data for Public Interest, Participation and Skills Sharing.\n\nIm Rahmen der Session auf der re:publica 2015 stellen Autorinnen des \"South2South\"-Manifests ihre Thesen zur Diskussion.\n\nPenhleak (Pinkie) Chan Managing Editor, Open Development Cambodia, Cambodia\n\nDickens Olewe Founder of AfricanSkyCAM and Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford University, Kenya & USA\n\nAlejandra Gutiérrez Valdizán Editor-in-Chief, Plaza Pública, Guatemala\n\nGuy Degen, Freelance Journalist, host\n\n \n",

			"title": "From Pong to Flappy Bird –  Copying and Genre Building in the Games Industry",
			"abstract": "The fine line between imitation and inspiration in computer game development has been a cause for conflicts since the beginning of the medium. Especially in the dynamic and competitive mobile games market, where game developers try to simultaneously out-innovate and out-clone each other, the issue has intensified. This talk presents a research project amongst German game developers on the tension between imitation and innovation and the shared social norms and strategies they mobilize to deal with this issue.",
			"description": "Imitation in computer games has been an issue since the beginning of the medium. Even the launch of the first commercially successful game, Pong, brought two developers into conflict, as Atari was accused of having stolen the idea of electronic Ping-Pong from Magnavox.\n\nMany disputes followed, both outside and inside court. For example, in 1988, Data East sued Epyx for copying their game Karate Champ, and in 2009 Xio was accused of making a Tetris clone. Recently, there also have been many cases of alleged cloning, such as Threes and Flappy Bird. It turns out that the complicated nature of games makes it nearly impossible to legally protect all of their elements.\n\nIn today’s games industry, frictions and conflicts seem to ever increase. Especially in mobile game development, where the low barriers for creating and publishing games as well as their immense popularity amongst broad audiences cause a flood of - at least at first glance - similar games.\n\nDevelopers face the challenge to create games that provide a certain familiarity in order to be playable and enjoyable on the one hand, and sufficient innovation and deviation to differentiate them on the other. Therefore, they heavily rely on and are inspired by proven genre conventions, interface designs, and graphical styles. Yet, there is also the need to combine known elements in novel ways or to add elements in order to create new experiences. Thus, rather than producing something radically new, innovation in games to a great extent consists of remixing and re-interpreting existing elements and principles. Strategies to deal with this differ amongst subsectors and disciplines.\n\nIn this talk, we will present a research project on innovation and imitation in the German games sector, conducted at the Humboldt Institute for Internet & Society. Based on interviews with Germany-based game developers, this presentation addresses different strategies that actors in the sector apply to cope with this situation.\n",

These can come from fields as diverse as civic education, arts and culture or social innovation.  \n\nIn der Aktion laden wir euch in einen digital-analogen europaweiten Raum für kreatives Projektdesign und „Co-Creation“ in Europa ein: Nach einem Einstieg in das Thema „Frische Ideen für Europa“ entwickelt ihr eure Idee für Europa (weiter) – unabhängig davon ob ihr Anfänger oder Experten in dem Bereich seid. Gerne in Teams, oder auch allein. Mithilfe kreativer Methoden des Projektdesigns (Prototyping, Design Thinking-Stil) lernt ihr, aus eurer Idee einen Prototypen für ein Vorhaben oder ein Projekt zu bauen. Im nächsten Schritt könnt ihr eure in der Aktion/Session entwickelten Prototypen auf der digitalen Ideenplattform www.advocate-europe.eu teilen. Teilnehmende und (wenn möglich) weitere Teilnehmer der re:publica wählen bis zum 7.5.2015 die beste Projektidee aus. Die Gewinner erhalten ein Projektcoaching und werden in das Netzwerk der „Advocate Europe“-Initiativen aufgenommen. \n\n> In our action you'll be invited to join our digital-and-analog space for creative project design and co-creation in Europe: A short intro and then it's up to you to come up with some fresh and wild ideas for Europe - no matter if you're an expert in the field or totally new. In teams, or alone, as you wish. We'll share some tools for project design (prototyping, design thinking-style) to build a project proposal.Then you can share your ideas on our platform, where we'll hold a voting until May 7, 2015 in order to find the best \"Advocate Europe\" idea at republica 2015. The winner receives a project coaching and will become part of the \"Advocate Europe\" network.\n\nJoin us on Tuesday 5/5, 2 P.M. or Wednesday 6/5, 2 P.M., find us on twitter through #AdvocateEurope, @juliamosaique or @rbrues\n\nLet us know if you're coming!  \n",

			"title": "Geschichte schreiben! Die Historiker und der digitale Raum.",
			"abstract": "Wie kommende Generationen auf das heutige Internet zurückblicken werden, hängt sehr von der Geschichtsschreibung zukünftiger Historiker ab. Welche Geschichtsbilder diese Historiker dabei prägen werden, hängt wiederum stark von den Quellen ab, die ihnen für ihre Forschung zur Verfügung stehen werden. Deshalb sind die Archivierung des Internet und die Geschichtsschreibung des digitalen Raumes keine akademischen Orchideen, sondern von hoher kultureller Bedeutung.",
			"description": "„Das Internet“ schreibt Geschichte, es beeinflusst massiv den Verlauf des Weltgeschehens. Die Geschichtswissenschaft, deren Aufgabe ja landläufig darin besteht, geschichtliche Zusammenhänge wissenschaftlich-kritisch zu analysieren und zu deuten, befasst sich bislang jedoch noch fast gar nicht mit dem Internet als historischem Phänomen. Man könnte das für ein Problem aus dem akademischen Elfenbeinturm halten, aber das wäre ein großer Fehler. Denn wie der Schriftsteller Samuel Butler schon sagte: „Der Unterschied zwischen Gott und den Historikern besteht hauptsächlich darin, dass Gott die Vergangenheit nicht mehr ändern kann.“ Geschichtsforschung produziert – das heißt: sie konstruiert – Geschichtsbilder, und diese sind oft hochpolitisch und mitunter Gegenstand erbitterter gesellschaftlicher Konflikte.\n\nJe weniger überlieferte (Schrift-)Quellen die Historiker für ihre Forschungen vorfinden, umso mehr Raum für freie Deutungen bleibt ihnen (sie müssen \"raten\", wohl oder übel). Wie viele und vor allem welche Quellen die Geschichtsforschung nutzen kann, hängt teilweise vom Zufall ab, hauptsächlich jedoch von der Arbeit fleißiger Archivare. Deshalb ist die Archivierung des Internet ein Schlüssel für eine gute Geschichtsschreibung des digitalen Raumes. Wenn nicht genug archiviert wird, dann versinken historische Phasen mangels ausreichender Quellengrundlage in der geschichtlichen Dunkelheit. Historiker nennen solche Perioden Dark Ages, und die Anfänge des World Wide Web stellen bereits eine solche Zeit dar.\n\nIn der Session werfe ich deshalb einen Blick in die Zukunft und versuche zu erahnen, wie künftige Historikergenerationen das heutige Internet als Forschungsgegenstand wahrnehmen werden. Welche Grundlagen für ihre Forschungen werden sie vorfinden, und wie wird das ihr Arbeiten und ihre Ergebnisse beeinflussen? Droht das heutige Internet (oder wichtige Teile davon) in geschichtlicher Dunkelheit zu versinken? Und falls ja, können wir dagegen noch irgendetwas tun?\n",

			"description": "Too many tech entrepreneurs still leave for the greener pastures of the United States when it comes to “going big”. What if there were a way for us to build a strong digital economy in Europe? \n\nWe can. Here’s the trick: The freedoms implicit in free and open source software (FOSS) licenses provide an even technology playing field upon which local SME digital service providers can measure their skills directly against the established international players – and win. With FOSS on our side we can leverage global tech communities while helping our European home regions and local economies. \n\nIn this talk I will show how the use of FOSS in governments and municipalities changed spending patterns and helped to keep millions in their local economies - be it the UK, Munich or even Gummersbach.\n\nLet’s take their example into business and talk about how Free and Open Source Software can help us to keep our data, our money, our businesses, our ideas, and our talent close to home!\n",

			"description": "Einerseits  postulieren wir eine neue Arbeitswelt, in der wir offen, transparent und ergebnisorientiert zusammen arbeiten. Andererseits sind wir schon etwas besorgt, seit wir mit Sicherheit wissen, dass unsere komplette digitale Kommunikation seitens Regierungen aufgezeichnet und gespeichert wird. Die Vermarktung unserer persönlichsten Daten durch Unternehmen wie  Google, Apple und Facebook macht das nicht besser.\n\nSeit einiger Zeit beginnen Unternehmen in Europa über die Einführung datenbasierter Personalentscheidungen nachzudenken. In den USA ist People Analytics bereits verbreitet.  In manchen Unternehmen, siehe Lidl & Co., sind unrechtmäßige Analysen von Mitarbeiterdaten bis hin zur vollständigen Überwachung Realität. Ausgewertete Verbindungsdaten aus Telefongesprächen und E-Mail Überwachung  führten zu fehlgeleiteten Repressionen - eine der Schattenseiten von Big Data im Personalmanagement.\n\nIndes bieten intelligente Analytics-Projekte, die im Einverständnis mit den Mitarbeitern transparent durchgeführt werden, eine einzigartige Chance unsere Arbeitswelt in allen ihren Dimensionen zu verbessern. Wir können mit Zahlen, Daten und Fakten beweisen, dass gemeinsame Kaffee- und Mittagspausen gut für den Arbeitserfolg sind. Partizipative Arten der Mitarbeiterführung und vernetztes Arbeiten bringen nicht nur Spaß im Job, sondern bergen zahlreiche finanzielle Chancen. So können aus in der Theorie entwickelten New Work Ansätzen konkrete Erfolgsfaktoren für Unternehmen und Mitarbeiter werden.\n\nUm die staatliche Überwachung nicht unternehmensintern fortzusetzen, müssen wir jetzt Fragen stellen und Regeln definieren:\n\nWelche Arten von Daten dürfen genutzt werden und welche nicht? Wer wertet diese Daten aus? Wie stellen wir sicher, dass der Mitarbeiter die Hoheit über seine Daten hat? Wie kann vermieden werden, dass Führungskräfte dieses Instrument unangemessen einsetzen und was passiert, wenn doch? Mit welchem “Code of Conduct” bleibt der Mensch Mensch im Fokus der Zahlen ...?\n",

			"abstract": "This talk will elaborate underlying psychological processes of the frequently stated explanation \"I've got nothing to hide\" with regard to privacy-negligent behavior. The core of this statement may be an implicit knowledge structure leading to trust into the concept of “collective privacy”, namely the trust that the privacy of one’s stored data is protected by the noise generated by the mass of all available information.  ",
			"description": "Despite reports and discussions about data collecting companies and surveillance through governmental institutions, citizens keep using Social Networking Sites (for example) in an unaltered manner. In my dissertation project I elaborated the statement “I’ve got nothing to hide” from a psychological perspective, as this is a frequently mentioned explanation for why online privacy is not handled with greater care.\n\nI argue that the basis of this argument is what psychological research calls a “subjective theory”, namely an intuitive (not necessarily correct) understanding of how online information is handled by other people and institutions. Such subjective theories have the structure of scientific theories, but generally develop on the basis of everyday experiences which – in the case of online communication – may pertain to the experience of information overload (i.e. the experience that the amount of available information extends one’s cognitive capacities). If people project this experience into their potential, unknown audience, they might expect that their own information will vanish in the noise created by the mass of all available data.\n\nThis talk will reflect on empirical data from a pertinent project conducted at the research training group 1712/1 “Trust and Communication in a Digitized World” of the German Research Foundation (DFG) in which we investigated the impact of perceived information density onto participants’ audience expectations. The talk will also reflect on the political dimension of such a subjective theory. \n",

While we, in the real 2015, are now close to being able to own Hover Boards, the development of freedom of speech seems to have shifted into reverse here in Southeast Asia. \r\n\r\nWhile the past has seen countries opening up & giving their citizens more rights & possibilities to access globally available information and to participate in international communication, governments now try to gain more control over public and private communication channels as well as to use their power to intimidate their respective netizens.",
			"description": "2014 and 2015 have seen quite some interesting developments in Southeast Asia. With the realization of AEC (ASEAN Economic Community - similar to the EU) closing in, many of the Southeast Asian states that are part of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations - if you want to now more, check here) try to become more open and more democratic. Since the idea of democracy in theory is obviously not the worst one, many countries started to move towards open elections and similar democratic values. \n\nHowever saying you use and follow democratic values and also doing so is often something quite different. Many times democracy seems to annoy the people in charge in participating countries that are new to the approach. It is not easy to actually have a working democratic system and still maintain all the power over ones people. Especially when the world wide web becomes part of the picture. \n\n\nThe problem is, we have too much democracy here! - Prime Minister (after a military coup) of Thailand. \n\n\nNot only the leader of the military junta in Thailand who now serves as Prime Minister sees democracy critical, other leaders and governments chime in on the 'the western democracy does not work here' complaint. While that can be argued from both sides one thing that now takes place quite frequently bothers everyone who is concerned about freedom of speech and information. Governments start to regulate the democracy they offer now more harshly and started to rule with more of an iron fist. \n\nIt is not only Thailand though. Other countries like Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Brunei and even Singapore are at eye level in terms of restricting (online) freedom and are also quite fast with pulling the trigger on blocking websites and online services. Especially social media and critical newspapers are the target of ASEAN Cyber Police forces in order to maintain law and order in the online space. \n\nAs mentioned in the short thesis this talk will touch on a few laws without getting too much into the law creation process but focusing on current examples and applications of ASEAN laws and policies. \n\nSince I teach at Universities in Thailand and also run a medium sized 'magazine' website here I will be able to share first hand experiences of me as lecturer as well as an editor and touch on what problems my Thai co-authors faced. \n",

Brauche ich nicht. Verstehe ich nicht. Kann ich nicht. So wehren noch viel zu viele Senioren das Internet ab. Diesen digitalen Graben werden wir nicht schließen können, wenn die jüngeren Generationen den älteren Menschen keine Brücken ins Netz bauen.\n\nInzwischen entdecken auch Eltern und Großeltern die sozialen Netzwerke, doch die Jugend reagiert verschreckt. Vorbei die Zeiten, als sich die Internetkommunikation von Eltern und Großeltern auf E-Mails beschränkte. Witze über die Unbeholfenheit der älteren Generation im Umgang mit Computern und sozialen Plattformen sind beliebt. Sie nützen aber niemandem. Die jüngeren Onliner sollten sich lieber um eine freundliche Willkommenskultur bemühen und bereitwillig Verantwortung übernehmen. Das zahlt sich langfristig aus.\n\nSoziale Netzwerke stärken die Familienbindung, wenn man sich immer seltener persönlich sieht. Sicherheit im Umgang mit Kommunikationsplattformen ist ein Mittel gegen Vereinsamung, wenn Senioren gelernt haben, dort ihr eigenes Ding zu machen. Verständnis für den Umgang mit digitalen Technologien fördert den Erhalt der Selbstständigkeit, wenn man gebrechlich oder tüddelig geworden ist. Modellprojekte hier und da sind zwar gut und schön, aber das reicht nicht.\n\nAnstelle blöder Muddawitze brauchen wir Netzpatenschaften. Jeder Onliner sollte sich um einen älteren Menschen in seinem Umfeld kümmern,  ihm die Vorteile von Vernetzung und digitalen Technologien schmackhaft machen und bei den ersten Schritten unterstützen. Dann kriegen wir nicht nur Familienleben 2.0 ans Laufen. \n",

			"abstract": "In many cases companies supply the high tech equipment for research. In the microscopy field, machinery for basic research is often so expensive that only first world labs can afford to participate. But science is not driven by companies. Scientists build the foundation on which commercial developers base their products. This is especially true for microscopy. In this field you also find a vibrant community and what these people came up with is worth a look.",
			"description": "When the term \"multi-platform\" was a vague idea and Java was not yet out there, there was already a community exchanging software to quantify microscopy images. From those first steps, which were not driven by states, funding agencies or institutes, but by engaged individuals, arose a remarkable free software package. In a \"grass-roots\" movement-manner, a lot of scientists participate in extending the software and even adapting it to control custom or commercial scientific hardware.\nThis talk is a little about ImageJ and its over 27 years of being used in biology and especially in microscopy. But it is far more about a community of users, sharing code and ideas, setting standards and beginning to deliver alternatives means of controlling hardware. This all seems hardly worth mentioning since it is quiet common in many aspects of our life with social media and communities. But in this case it is about controlling high-end scientific machinery and doing research with it.\nA rather concrete goal, and with the effort of many scientists over the past 27 years, there is also a surprising result: you can cut the cost of a microscope by 95%, because you do not have to think about how to control it – the software is there. Just recently there was a publication entitled \"A Blueprint for Cost-Efficient Localization Microcopy\" explaining this in detail.\nTo summarize, a community founded at a time when using a mouse at your computer was \"the new thing\" has developed a versatile free software package, which has now reached the point of influencing the hardware in the way that not only the well funded parts of the scientific world can do high-end microscopy - everyone can.\n",

But sharing is just the beginning. The real purpose behind it is profiling. Be that our insurance or health care scheme, unemployment benefit or school curriculum – more and more services depend not so much on who we are in reality, but on the quality of our digital profile.

			"description": "Most Internet companies, when challenged on privacy grounds, respond \"sharing everything is users' own choice\". Is it really? More and more often we are forced to exist as a digital profile.\n\nOur flight patterns will soon be used to determine what level of security risk we create for the society; our consumer profile may become the main proxy to determine our credit-worthiness; our credit-score opens or blocks access to other types of financial services (incl. insurance); teaching from primary schools to universities seeks \"individualisation\" based on heavy use of big data; unemployment and social security benefits in many countries come with intrusive questionnaires and screenings – from consumption records to health data.\n\nMany companies offer discount schemes for those, who are prepared to share more: geo-location, shopping lists, exercise schemes... Who controls this game? Who knows the algorithm?\n\nThis talk will explore various contexts, in which citizens and human beings are reduced to their digital profiles and social consequences of this reduction. I will look at practical cases of profiling in private and public sector that involve important social or individual stakes (banking or insurance services, employment, public education, health-related services, social benefits). I will explain the fallacy of delegating decisions to algorithms and expose commercial interests behind this trend. Last but not least, I will look at the function of digital profiles from philosophical perspective: who is more real for the society – me or my profile?\n",

			"description": "In Phillip K. Dick’s short story The Minority Report there are no murders. How? A system of pre-crime policing that is widely considered to be infallible identifies suspects before they have a chance to kill... Here’s an excerpt:\n\n\"With the aid of your precog mutants, you've boldly and successfully abolished the post-crime punitive system of jails and fines. As we all realize, punishment was never much of a deterrent, and could scarcely have afforded comfort to a victim already dead.\"\n\nThey had come to the descent lift. As it carried them swiftly downward, Anderton said: \"You've probably grasped the basic legalistic drawback to precrime methodology. We’re taking in individuals who have broken no law.”\n\n“But surely they will,” Witwer affirmed with conviction.\n\n“Happily they don’t – because we get them first, before they can commit an act of violence. So the commission of the crime itself is absolute metaphysics. We claim they’re culpable. They, on the other hand, eternally claim they’re innocent. And, in a sense they are innocent… In our society we have no major crimes…but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals.”\n\nSo in this fictional- ahem- society no crime exists because as Anderton says “we get them first”. As people we have an aversion to certain emotions and feelings, when terrible things happen we tend to think and philosophise about how we can stop them happening again. To stop something happening before it happens. Sound familiar?\n\nThe raison d'etre of the Five Eyes surveillance apparatus is pre-crime. Stop the terrorists before they can attack. In this talk I aim to demonstrate how a variety of the surveillance programmes use Big Data methodologies and techniques to bring Phillip K. Dick's The Minority Report to life.\n",

A group of contributors can create high quality content in a short period of time with the help of effective collaboration techniques. Collaboration is a skill to be learned. We discuss Book Sprints and Data Expeditions as examples of how to successfully structure collaborative knowledge production, making use of both online and offline tools and spaces.\r\n",
			"description": "Working with groups to produce knowledge in forms of books, data storytelling, databases, and other media is effective and enriching if done right. Collaboration can range from weak to strong, from sending the occasional email to going on intense teamwork retreats. The stronger the collaboration, the more the differences of opinions, experiences, working styles, and time zones come into play. Questions of co-ownership and sharing need to be negotiated. A structured process such as a Book Sprint or a Data Expedition facilitates successful collaboration by creating an enabling environment in online and offline spaces.\n\nBook Sprints bring together a group to produce a book in 3-5 days. Without any pre-production, the group is guided by a facilitator from zero to published book. Close to a hundred books, from software manuals to fiction, have been written that way. Data Expeditions are guided quests to discover, map and storify data to follow a question or solve a problem. The method is used by School of Data to foster learning by doing while working with real data, creating real results. Book Sprints and Data Expeditions stress learning and exchange as much as the outcome. We discuss different tools and techniques, online platforms, publishing methods, peer learning, and real-time and real-space collaboration.\n",

Der Vortrag möchte ein paar mögliche Antworten auf diese Fragen geben, die in Zeiten von #Gamergate, #idpet, #schauhin und #aufschrei immer drängender werden.\n\nLasst uns also über \"Meinungsfreiheit!!1!\" reden, über Taktiken gegen den Hass, Medienkompetenz und unsere Verantwortung für ein freie(re)s Internet in dem das Motto heißt: \"Don’t feed the apathy!\"\n",

			"description": "Of coffee, tech, making, Singapore and #selfies. \n\nWhat's the difference between meeting over coffee versus meeting over a drink? Since the Age of Enlightenment we've made that social distinction. Then we had Cybercafe's which is an \"All of this has happened before, and will happen again\" type situation. Todays tech start-ups have been infamously linked with hipster culture, and it's not accidental that hipster cafe's are coffee joints. And now selfie-sticks are a thing. Coincidence?\n\nIntroducing the Caffeinator. The DIY gravity-powered cold drip coffee machine. Made from A result of, quite simply, being a geek.\n\nAlso introducing the #SelfieBooth: An IkeaHack that is (quite possibly) the worlds first and only Butt-Activated Instagramming selfie booth that happens to feature (quite possibly) the worlds most energy-efficient-high-definition-selfie screen. \n\nThis is about how and why these two came to be a thing, how mass produced, ubiquitous, and \"everyday things\" can be combined to make something entirely new. \n\nAlso a little about Asian culture and the growing maker community in Singapore, how the HackerSpaces have inspired MakerSpaces, and the other way round, creating an inter-disciplinary dynamic.

			"title": "Civic Tech and NGOs: How collaboration can drive Transparency and Accountability around the world ",
			"abstract": "In the last decade the development and take up of digital technologies has driven an unprecedented change in civic activism and civic spaces. Established NGOs have often been slow to understand and engage with these shifting dynamics and the new culture of sharing and reusing technology.\r\n\r\nMany traditional NGOs have incredible experience in working in challenging environments - there is now a huge opportunity for these change makers to work more closely with digital tool makers and activists to empower citizens in the areas of transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nThis session is intended as an open discussion between the traditional NGO environment and the tech activism scene. Informed by both side’s Tech for Transparency and Accountability work, the session is bringing together a range of inputs from activists, technologists, practitioners and academics. The objective is to help define the steps that need to be taken in order to enable the civic tech scene and traditional NGOs to work more closely together - to use their combined skills to bring about more significant, sustainable change. \r\n",
			"description": "The pervasion of information and communication technologies has been increasing over the last decade. At the same time we have seen people increasingly rise up around the world, claiming agency over their own situations in shaping or challenging political systems they live in.\n\nNow more than ever organisations all over the world are holding governments to account, challenging corruption, and demanding the right to transparency, and they are using digital technologies to do so.\n\nWhy should every civic organisation have to write their software from scratch? If you wanted to start a blog, you would never thinking of writing new software to do it - you would use Tumblr or Wordpress.\n\n- This is the question the newly born Poplus Movement is putting out there.\n\nWith increasingly globally networked activism, new networks are emerging - those of hackers and tech activists, crafting tools that enable citizens to make their voices heard, reveal injustice on a new scale and challenge their duty bearers.\n\nSuch rapidly shifting dynamics should have clear implications for more conventional NGOs in the field of governance and citizenship. However, in many contexts, NGOs keep building their own tools rather than engaging with those new civic networks to explore ways of moving closer together.\n\nFor example, Oxfam’s representation in more than 90 countries, mainly working through their vast network of local partner organisations bears immense diversity where technologies can play a facilitating role in enabling change mechanisms. However, such more traditional NGOs also need to recognize the role new technologies play in the realms of shifting civil society and civic agency. At the same time, accessibility and availability of internet based tech space remains scarce in many parts of the world. Therefore, Oxfam and mySociety started exploring the potentials to engage with each others and to create allies to directly link their local partners with those frontrunners of civic driven networks.\n\nThis workshop invites representatives from the entire spectrum to explore what is needed to move the civic tech scene and the more traditional NGO scene closer together and take a consequent path towards increased sharing and reusing of code and existing tools. How can this look like and how can we hook up local partners with the globally growing civic tech scene?\n\nSuch questions will be discussed during re:publica with a diverse group of people from all strands of the play. We aim to co-create a collaboration roadmap, collect a series of case studies and potentially gather a committed group to forge the conditions to move forward.\n\nLet us know if you will join: http://lanyrd.com/2015/republica/\n",

			"description": "When Ronald Reagan launched the \"Star Wars\"-Program in 1983, Science Fiction seemed to become part of the reality. At least as far as politics were concerned, because the technology has not been evolved that far yet. Still it implicated political and military consequences on an international level and eventually became a thread for the balance of the Cold War. How to handle these new born threads and what to do about the concept of Weapons in Space, has broadly been subject to Science Fiction novels.\n\nThis talk is based on my Master Thesis and offers an historic approach on the Militarization of Space and the reception in Science Fiction literature.\n",

			"title": "Don't panic, it's your data! Teaching (better) privacy in European schools",
			"abstract": "Tomorrow’s European digital society must be educated today on the value of privacy and personal data protection. But how to do it effectively and without ridicule? Should kids and teens be told to stay away from the Internet, and learn to never share? Or should they rather go ahead believing in the force of privacy protection? A review of current educational practices, staging obsolete technologies, bizarre kid-friendly characters and a few horror movies, attempts to raise these questions.",
			"description": "Educating children and teens on the importance of privacy and personal data protection is relatively high on the agendas of policy makers and of the European privacy community. Schools, it is argued, play a crucial rule in enlightening the adults of tomorrow, too often confused by the questionable ‘privacy policies’ and ‘privacy settings’ of the services they use, and often unable to get any relevant guidance from parents that are fundamentally just as unaware of their rights as them, and typically even less comfortable with the latest socio-technological trends. But how to effectively elevate European youth to a higher degree of privacy awareness? And how to do it in a way that is not completely outmoded? How to get the message across despite the generational gap that separates the established privacy community and its moving, growing, clicking and over-sharing target audience? A panoramic review of initiatives currently in place in Europe shows disparate approaches. Between funny potato-like characters announcing to children that they are the real masters of their personal data, and threatening movies aiming to generate distrust of the net’s darkest side, the underlying message is actually sometimes simply unclear. This Talk will provide concrete examples of material developed for privacy education in Europe, questioning to which extent it effectively elevates children and teens into a better understanding of their rights, and of how to use them as minors today, and tomorrow as adults. Illustrated with a selection of videos, pictures, comics and slogans, it will put forward the question of whether approaches such as a simple classroom discussion or interactive theatre could be the best way to engage a productive, informative dialogue with teens and children. The presentation is based on extensive research conducted for the project ARCADES, Introducing Data Protection and Privacy Issues at Schools in the European Union.\n",

Welche rechtlichen Grundlagen gibt es und welche Rahmenbedingungen ergeben sich daraus? Nach einem Blick auf die Arbeitsbedingungen in Behörden schauen wir uns an, welche Netzwerke und Inhalte mit Monitoring-Tools beobachtet werden können und was heute schon in Europa regional und sprachlich abgedeckt wird. Dabei versuchen wir auch die Frage zu klären, ob die Möglichkeiten von Social Media Monitoring vielleicht überschätzt werden. Darüber hinaus sollen mögliche Anwendungsfelder von Social Media Monitoring im öffentlichen Sektor verdeutlichen, warum es sinnvoll sein kann, wenn Behörden dem Bürger im Netz endlich zuhören.\n\n \n",

How close or far are you from the proposed standard of being a manly male man of utter masculinity?\n\nSo many question that you didn't even know you had, right?

			"description": "Das Bildungssystem war spät dran, als die Bundesregierung ihre „Strategie Digitale Bildung“ veröffentlichte, damals in 2015. So gut wie alle anderen gesellschaftlichen Bereiche waren schon vom Digitalen Wandel erfasst worden. Viele Menschen hatten gedacht, dass die Schule immun gegenüber Veränderungen sei. Handyverbote und gesperrte Netze hatten zumindest bis 2016 den Eindruck erweckt, man könne so weitermachen wie bisher. Aber dann war ein Tipping Point erreicht, von dem aus sich die Dinge überschlugen.\n\nAngetrieben wurde die Entwicklung von unten, über die privaten Geräte, die die Schüler/innen ungefragt mit in die Schulen brachten. Man versuchte 2016 zwar noch, die Smartwatches und später die Brillen-Cams genau wie vorher Handys aus den Schulen auszusperren. Aber das kippte endgültig im September 2016 mit dem Urteil des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, das der Schülerin Yasmin K. das Tragen eines Multifunktionsarmbands gemeinsam mit einem unsichtbaren Funk-Hörimplantat aus gesundheitlichen Gründen erlaubte.\n\nDie Politik trat die Flucht nach vorne an. Nach der Landtagswahl in Nordrhein-Westfalen im Frühjahr 2017 löste Schwarz-Grün umgehend das gemeinsame Wahlversprechen ein, flächendeckend jede/r Schüler/in ein digitales Endgerät im Schulalltag nutzen zu lassen. Andere Bundesländer zogen nach – bis zum Großen Crash 2020. Als 13 von 16 Bundesländern kurz vor der Zahlungsunfähigkeit stande, sagte der Bund Unterstützung zu.\n\nDie Bundesländer mussten dafür eine De-Facto-Zentralisierung der Schulpolitik zulassen. Das stärkste Argument der Befürworter zog: Nachdem 16 Bundesländer 16 inkompatible Lernplattformen aufgebaut hatten, bedeutete ein Umzug für die Schüler meist einen Verlust des eigenen Lernportfolios und der Datenprofile. Eine Zentralisierung war unvermeidlich geworden.\n\nUnd das war erst der Anfang. Heute im Jahr 2025 können wir rückblickend sagen: Jeder Schritt war willkommen. Es gab nie einen Bösen. Alle wollten immer nur das Beste. Und trotzdem (oder deswegen?) haben wir heute ein totalüberwachtes und umfassend kontrolliertes System im Bildungsbereich etabliert, das jedes Blinzeln jedes Lernenden registriert und auswertet. Wie konnte es dazu kommen?\n\nDer Vortrag sucht Antworten in einer chronologischen Rückschau auf die konkreten Entwicklungen von 2015 bis 2025.\n",

			"title": "AI-kindergarten: Building AI using the theory of practopoiesis",
			"abstract": "Using the theory of practopoiesis, I will define first the problem of building biological-like artificial intelligence (or strong AI) and then explain the optimal efforts needed for a successful solution. This effort will require transferring knowledge from humans to machines in a manner that is more similar to what teachers do in preschools than what programmers and engineers do in labs. Thus, to create a strong AI, we will first have to create and employ a gigantic AI-kindergarten.",
			"description": "So far, artificial intelligence (AI) failed to achieve biological-like levels of intelligence. The recent theory of practopoiesis (http://www.danko-nikolic.com/practopoiesis/) tells us why: The existing systems are not sufficiently adaptive. Practopoiesis can also guide us to exactly pinpoint where the problems are and how to fix them. The problems stem from the fact that the knowledge must be stored in a much more general form than what we usually allow to AI. Moreover, limitations come from the sheer amount of cybernetic knowledge that needs to be accumulated and the intensive feedback from the environment required during the accumulation process. The consequence is that, unlike us, machines lack a vast amount of basic knowledge to begin their learning process with. This is a how-to-learn knowledge and would be a machine’s equivalent to starting a biological life with an already well-established genome—which required millions of years of painstaking trials and errors by our ancestors.\n\nA shortcut for building AI possessing similar basic knowledge can be found from the fact that our own behavior already reflects the knowledge stored in our genome (following from the principle of knowledge transcendence of practopoiesis). In my talk, will propose a knowledge transfer theorem, enabling us to extract this knowledge from human operators and instill it into machines. I will also reveal a set of procedures that make this transfer of knowledge possible based on human-machine interaction. The theorem tells us that we can transfer knowledge from our genome to machine “genome”. Consequently, the effort to build biological-like adaptive AI (a.k.a., artificial general intelligence, or strong-AI) will primarily not involve programming and learning-databases. Rather, the process will heavily rely on an effort of interacting with machines much similar to the way in which we interact with, and teach, our biological children. This extensive effort shall be known as AI-kindergarten.\n",

			"title": "Arbeiten, wo andere feiern – Berliner Clubkulturen als Motor kreativwirtschaftlicher Arbeitsformen",
			"abstract": "„Party machen ist harte Arbeit“ tönte einst Hotelerbin Paris Hilton von der Titelseite eines Herrenmagazins. Clubs sind im Jahr 2015 wirtschaftliche Cluster, die mit ihrem Tätigkeitsportfolio immer stärker in die Kreativwirtschaft hineinwachsen, aber dieser auch skeptisch gegenüberstehen. Wenn sich Sub- und Hochkulturen immer stärker annähern, für wen sind Clubkulturen dann konzipiert und wer arbeitet an und in ihnen? ",
			"description": "Anhand von fünf empirischen Interviews wurde das Thema Erwerbsarbeit in den Berliner Clubkulturen erörtert. Es entstand eine Skizze differenzierter Vorstellungen von Arbeit, Strukturen und Verbindlichkeiten für jene, die in Clubs ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienen. Das Konzept der Kreativwirtschaft wird zudem als Schablone eines neuen, neoliberal geprägten Verständnisses der Subjektivierung von Erwerbstätigkeit durch das Raster der Clubkulturen der jüngeren Gegenwart analysiert.\n\nDas vorläufige Ergebnis dieser Forschung sind vier Dimensionen des Arbeitens, die die Bereiche Geschlechter(un)verhältnisse, Emotionalisierung von Arbeit, Risiko und den Ethos des Do-it-Yourself berühren. Mit diesem Portfolio sollen Fragen an die Umgestaltung des Konzeptes „Arbeit“ aufgegriffen werden. Die sukzessive Auflösung des scheinbaren Gegensatzes von Arbeits- und Freizeitorten führt auch zum Ende distinguierter Räume des zivilen Rückzugs vor der Allmacht der Arbeitswelt, die wie kein anderes Konzept Herkunft, Kultur, Geschlechter, Habitus und Religionen gegenwärtig transzendiert. Nischen werden kleiner und zu mehr oder minder lukrativen Themenparks von sich als kreativ-urban verstehenden gesellschaftlichen Gruppen. Die dabei entstehenden Verschiebungen spiegeln sich auch in der räumlichen Neustrukturierung Berlins nach 1990 wieder, wobei auch zunehmend Migrant_innen aus der ganzen Welt Berlin als post-touristischen Standort definieren.\n\nEine Analyse der Arbeit innerhalb von Clubkulturen verrät dabei viel über die sich wandelnde Konzipierung und den Umfang von Arbeits- und Vergnügungsbezirken sowie über Urbanität generierende und simulierende Stadtsegmente.\n",

The build will be filmed using high definition time-lapse cinematography, streamed and remixed live on www.utopia.fm.\n\nUtopia is a work of art in which community, spoken word, and software build to create a live performance, a multiplayer game, and a radical legal form, that captures the fears and aspirations of its participants encoded on the block chain.\n\nThe format of the presentation would be as discursive as we can make it.

Recent developments have highlighted the shaky balance on which the call for freedom and human rights online are currently based. While the creation of a Special Rapporteur for the Right to Privacy may certainly be seen as a positive sign, other measures and changes in legislation are less promising. Featuring four speakers, two American, two German, the panel will outline the main challenges and explore why it is vital to include a broad range of voices and perspectives to shape the debate and influence security-inspired rhetorics in a positive manner.

At the same time, bridging possible clashes and opening the respective debates between the \"Internet Governance crowd\" and the \"Cybersecurity folks\", the panelists will attempt to highlight different angles to cybersecurity that need to be considered in order to hold a well-informed discussion.\n",

			"abstract": "In the second decade of the 21st century it has become obvious, that we are beginning to see what a rich, colorful and rewarding sexual culture for human beings can look like. The internet, which has been rumored to be for porn, has shown that erotica and pornographic images, film and text are much more than what used to be available in a brown bag at a seedy shop. The myth that women don't like porn has been debunked by a larger variety of porn and pornographers. \r\nA democratic, equal and healthy society has to help sex, erotica and porn out of the sometimes still seedy image they suffer under and give these parts of human nature their deserved portion of normality, cultivation and love. ",
			"description": "Sex sells. But not only goods and services but ideas about sex. And the ideas about sex in mainstream media are often still traditional and conservatie. Slap on some naked female bodyness and the male audience will be transfixed. This simple formula might still work with a certain audience but it is becoming more and more old for a lot of people. They want more than just eternal cheesecake.\n\nThe holder's of the old-school grale of female eyecandy are faced with petitions and activism to ban pictures of scantly clad ladies in tabloids and bans on sexist ads. But is this really the best solution? Banning stuff usually makes things worse. Why not diversify instead? It would be much more fun to open up the idea of what symbolizes sex.\n\nJust think of it: Would't it be much more rewarding to cultivtivate and enjoy sex and erotica equal with other human needs like food? Why should porn just be low culture trash and why can't a sex worker be as respected as a doctor? And why is sex stilly mystified as some weird black box? This has to change.\n",

Von #Tatort zu Candy Crush, von der Auswahl unserer Instagrambilder zu den rebloggten Posts auf Tumblr – täglich signalisieren wir aufs Neue unseren (gewünschten) Status und was uns wichtig ist. Was sich daraus über uns lernen lässt und wie so das Netz geformt wird, wird in dieser Session an allerlei Beispielen erklärt.",
			"description": "Big Data und die Auswertung großer Datenmengen ist immer wieder Bestandteil von netzpolitischen Debatten. Doch mindestens genauso interessant ist die gezielte Streuung der Daten, die wir Tag für Tag vornehmen. Was wir auf Facebook posten, wem wir auf Twitter folgen, welche Hashtags wir benutzen, was für ein Profilbild wir wählen – all das verrät mehr über uns und unsere soziale Stellung, als uns bewusst ist. Gleichzeitig grenzen wir uns durch die Art und Weise, wie wir online kommunizieren, klar von manchen Gruppen ab. \n\nDaten werden zur Abgrenzung genutzt – und formen so das Netz. So wie unser Habitus bestimmt, wie wir uns kleiden, sprechen oder welche Musik wir hören, so bestimmt der digitale Habitus wie wir uns im Netz bewegen. Der Vortrag zeigt auf, wo sich dadurch Gefahren und vielleicht auch Potenziale auftun, und warum es wichtig ist, sich der Distinktion der Daten zumindest bewusst zu sein.\n\nDabei wird einleitend kurz der Habitusbegriff erklärt, und was mit Distinktion gemeint ist. Dann wird versucht, an verschiedenen Beispielen aufzuzeigen, wo wir online Status signalisieren und was für Schlüsse daraus gezogen werden sollten. Auch und gerade für alle geeignet, die mit soziologischen Konzepten nichts am Hut haben.\n",

It will also explore the challenges and opportunities to oppose these activities, including current proposals to limit data use and transfer. Finally, the panel will highlight the effective practices of anti-surveillance activists worldwide who have begun to hamper surveillance by disrupting these networks.",
			"description": "Modern government surveillance relies on a system of legal data collection authorities, cross-border data transfer agreements, and cooperation of private companies, either voluntarily or by legal compulsion. Under the apparent guise of national security, this system creates a dynamic global surveillance machine that intrudes on the international human rights of users with little to no transparency or accountability.\n\nIn the wake of the revelations of government surveillance programs, specifically in the U.S. and UK (made possible by Edward Snowden), several proposals have arisen to limit government reach and authority, both at home and abroad. However, little action has been taken by lawmakers toward implementation of these proposals, and, in fact, many of the proposals are based on misunderstands or misinformation about how the system works.\n\nFinally, in the midst of these legal battles, users are demanding recognition of their individual rights through reform of laws and corporate policies. From the United States to Kenya to Germany, and beyond, users have gathered together to demand an end to bulk, untargeted surveillance practices that treat treat everyone as criminals and bad actors.\n\nThis session will explain how the surveillance machine is organized and the challenges and opportunities to reform and fix the system. Special attention will be paid to grassroots movements that have popped up around the world to support change, with the goal of answering the most basic question: how can we protect users?\n",

Frustrated by the traditional live music experience, the Sofar Sounds founders Rafe and Rocky hosted three young artists who played to a carefully selected audience of true music lovers in their apartment. And after that show, those people went and told their friends... Six years later and thanks to the effort of volunteers worldwide as well as social platforms Sofar Sounds is now probably the world’s largest live music discovery community.",

There are at least two shows every day somewhere in somebodies flat. In Germany you’ll find Sofar Sounds shows in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Essen. Guests don’t have to pay for entrance. And they don’t know which artists will perform until the show starts. So they have the chance to discover new music. Sofar Sounds has been growing very fast and is still growing. \n\nThe idea is to discuss with one of the founders, a volunteer and somebody from the music business why Sofar Sounds is so successful, what were and are the difficulties and which role does social media play.

Warum geht nicht einmal eine Suche nach dem günstigsten Ticket in den nächsten Nachbar-Verkehrsverbund, die deine Monatskarte mit berücksichtigt? Und warum stellen heutige Apps ÖPNV, Fahrrad- und Carsharing als konkurrierende Alternativen, aber nicht _inter_modal dar? Innovation findet immer noch top-down statt, mit großen Forschungsprojekten. Es wird Zeit für Open-Source-Innovation!",
			"description": "Eine ganze Reihe von Apps sorgt mittlerweile dafür, bequem und günstig von A nach B zu kommen. ÖPNV-Verbindungen werden schön aufbereitet, mit Taxis, Car- und Bikesharing verglichen – da ist die autofreie Stadt nicht mehr weit!\n\nAber weit gefehlt. Wer nämlich mit dem eigenen Rad zur Bahn und danach mit dem Miet-Smart günstiger zum Ziel käme, bekommt diese Auskunft nicht. Denn, egal welche App: ÖPNV, Rad und Taxi werden immer noch als Konkurrenten dargestellt, nicht als Gesamtsystem. Und was in Berlin prima funktioniert, stößt anderswo ganz schnell an seine Grenzen. Wer von einem Verbundsystem in ein anderes möchte, bekommt von der DB ein „Preisauskunft nicht möglich“ um die Ohren gehauen. Eine Least-Cost-Auskunft, die eine eigene Monatskarte für die Hälfte der Strecke berücksichtigt? Undenkbar. Und sobald Staatsgrenzen überschritten werden, scheitern die Apps.\n\nAber warum? Warum halten die Verbünde ihre Auskunftssysteme – die als Basis für die Mobilitätsapps dienen – für unantastbar? Warum müssen wir uns mit One-Size-Fits-All-Lösungen herumschlagen? Warum findet die Weiterentwicklung immer noch nur in millionenschweren, trägen Forschungsprojekten statt, anstatt durch Civic-Hacking-Projekte?\n\nWas dort nämlich bereits passiert ist, ist großartig: Von in Eigeninitiative entstandenen Abfahrtsanzeigen an öffentlichen Orten, bis zu selbstgelöteten Sensoren, um verspätete Busse zu registrieren. Und was alles möglich wäre: Bessere Auskünfte für Menschen mit Rolli oder Kinderwagen. Die beste Tramstrecke von A nach B mit einem Zwischenstopp für einen Supermarkteinkauf. Das Auto-Navi, das den P+R-Parkplatz am Rand der nächsten Stadt ansteuert, um ohne Stau und mit günstiger Anbindung zum endgültigen Ziel zu kommen. Oder Offene Hardware, die kleinen Busunternehmen überhaupt erst ermöglicht, Echtzeitinformationen und gesicherte Umsteigeverbindungen anzubieten.\n\nDie Open-Transit-Bewegung kann viel erreichen – und aus ÖPNV für Menschen auch einen ÖPNV mit Menschen machen.

			"description": "Was ist das nächste große Ding im WTF-Marketing? Was passiert, wenn man Tausende Menschen zu einem Spam-Massendialog verdrahtet? Und was steht eigentlich im \"Web-Adress-Buch für Deutschland\"? Die Antworten stehen in der taz-Kolumne \"Nullen und Einsen\".\n\n\"Click + Collect bedeutet: Zu Hause am Computer die Waren aussuchen und sie sich dann im stationären Handel abholen. Sprich: Man kann die Sachen vorher nicht anfassen und ausprobieren, sie werden aber auch nicht nach Hause geliefert. Also das Schlechteste aus zwei Welten, ein wenig so, als würde man in ein Kino im Nachbarbezirk fahren, eine Viertelstunde anstehen und sieben Euro für eine Karte bezahlen, mit der man einen Film dann zu Hause und nur zu einer bestimmten Zeit auf dem 11-Zoll-Laptopbildschirm mit Scheppersound gucken kann. Und vor einem sitzt ein Mann, der seinen Zylinder nicht abnimmt, und schmatzt ganz laut.\"\n\n\"Das Problem heißt ELSTER Online, die – knickknack, Akronym! – ELektronische STeuerERklärung. Ein Zeichen der deutschen Finanzämter, im Online-Zeitalter angekommen zu sein, ein Angebot… nein, eben gerade KEIN Angebot. Jedenfalls nicht, wenn man als Freiberufler Umsatzsteuervoranmeldungen und -erklärungen machen muss. Die gehen nämlich nur noch mit Elster. Auf Papier ist es verboten. Verboten! Und Elster ist die Hölle, die digitale Version vom „Haus, das Verrückte macht“, aus „Asterix erobert Rom“, speziell wenn man einen Mac nutzt (was unter Freiberuflern gar nicht so selten vorkommt, wie man hört).\"\n\n \n",

			"description": "Europa hat ein Identitätsproblem, und das schon lange. Nicht nur im Blick auf die Vergangenheit ist unklar, wer dazu gehört, wer nicht und wie diese Zugehörigkeit definiert wird. Das europäische Gemeinsamkeitsgefühl stolpert immer wieder über nationale Reflexe. Immer wenn ein Teil bereit ist zu mehr Gemeinsamkeit, entdeckt ein anderer seine Wehwehchen neu. Die kontinentalen Integrationsprozesse der EU-Bürger wollen einfach nicht so recht funktionieren. Doch der SPD-Vorsitzende Sigmar Gabriel sagt: “Europa ist mehr als eine bloße Freihandelszone.” Wünschenswert wäre es.\n\nDoch warum will Europa als Werte- und Kulturgemeinschaft einfach nicht in die Gänge kommen? Welche gemeinsame Identität kann und will Europa schaffen, über einen reinen Nicht-Kriegs- und Wirtschaftsunionsgedanken hinaus? Warum ist Europa vielmehr eine gespaltene Persönlichkeit - eine Diva mit so vielen Gesichtern und Launen wie es EU-Länder gibt, mit lauten und leisen Stimmen, schweren und kleineren Krisen, vor allem aber mit einem Hang zur psycho-pathologischen Dauerkrise in Sachen Identität?\n\nUm diese zentralen Fragen zur Zukunft zu beantworten, hilft nur eines: Europa muss auf die Couch. Therapie als Allheilmittel gegen Krisen, dieses Prinzip durchdringt längst die ganze Gesellschaft, wir wenden es im großen Stil an: Affe im Kopf hilft Europa bei der Analyse des Ist-Zustands - und das anhand ihrer digitalen Repräsentanz. Wie stellt sich die wehleidige Lady Europa im Netz dar, dem einzigen Ort, wo ihre Einwohner alle zueinander finden können? Wir lassen Persönlichkeitspsychologen auf das digitale Europa schauen. Wir konstruieren einen Rohrschachtest aus den Symbolen Europas, wir programmieren Europa neurolinguistisch um und stellen die Mitgliedsstaaten der EU zur Familienaufstellung auf die re-publica Bühne. “Dr. Freud and Mrs. Europe” ist Therapiesitzung und multimediale Performance.

In dem Workshop wollen wir uns zunächst den Stand der Forschung anschauen, um dann die besagte Generation selbst zu Wort kommen zu lassen. Denn wer kann besser Auskunft geben über die Nutzungsgewohnheiten der Jugend, als sie selbst?",
			"description": "Die Verkaufszahlen von Printprodukten (und damit auch die Werbeumsätze) gehen fast ausnahmslos rapide zurück, während die durchschnittliche Onlineverweildauer via Computer, Tablet oder Smartphone kumuliert steigt. Die technische Innovation Internet hat bestimmte Aspekte des Alltagslebens nachhaltig verändert. Mit zunehmender Online-Verbreitung sinken die Verkaufszahlen und Umsätze der Medien: Mal wird Internet als der Totengräber, mal als die Rettung des Journalismus erklärt. Aber was ist eigentlich mit den jungen Leuten? Wie stillt ein durchschnittlicher 17-jähriger sein/ihr Informationsinteresse? Welche Medien, Seiten, Netzwerke nutzt dieser junge Mensch über den die nicht mehr ganz so jungen Leute verächtlich bis bewundernd gerne und viel reden? Oft mit einem emphatisch tradierten Kulturpessimismus, der seit hunderten von Jahren gepflegt wird und hauptsächlich negatives über die nachfolgende Generation zu berichten weiß. Doch dieser Kulturpessimismus sagt meistens wenig über eine Generation aus, sondern mehr über den Postulaten und dessen gekränkte Eitelkeit, da die Nachfolgegeneration tradierte Verhaltensweisen nicht 1 zu 1 übernommen hat und eigene Wege geht. 2015 wird der Jahrgang, in dessen Geburtsjahr (1997) DSL flächendeckend in Deutschland eingeführt wurde, volljährig. Wir möchten daher nicht über die Generation der Unterzwanzigjährigen reden, sondern versuchen uns in sie hineinzuversetzen. Und das geht am besten, wenn man sie fragt und mit ihnen redet. Unser Workshop Generationenempathie versucht eigene bzw. bekannten Verhaltensweisen und Mediennutzungsverhalte zu ignorieren und sich in junge Menschen hineinzuversetzen, um eine Perspektive für den Journalismus und der Informatiosgewinnung der Zukunft zu entwickeln. Dafür möchten wir uns erst mit aktuellen Ergebnissen aus der Forschung auseinandersetzen und dann mit denen zusammensetzten, die es wirklich wissen müssen: 4 Mädchen und Jungen zwischen 14 und 17. Sie sollen selbst zu Wort kommen und vorurteilsfrei sagen, wie sie sich informieren und auch unterhalten.\n",

LaterPay führt den digitalen Bierdeckel in der Internetökonomie ein und vereinfacht das Verkaufen von Inhalten. Durch Entkoppelung von Kauf und Zahlung bei Kleinstbeträgen wird die Eintrittsbarriere für Bezahlinhalte gesenkt. Der Nutzer bekommt mit nur zwei Klicks Zugang zum Inhalt - ohne Anmeldung oder Vorabregistrierung. Erst ab einer Summe von 5 Euro registriert sich der Nutzer und bezahlt. Die drei Medienpartner setzen LaterPay seit einigen Monaten ein. Richard Gutjahr experimentiert bereits länger am bestmöglichen Einsatz von LaterPay auf www.gutjahr.biz. Quintessenz seiner Erfahrungen: Die Leser sind bereit, für hochwertige Inhalte zu zahlen – und zwar auch höhere Beträge. Darauf setzt auch der Journalist Sebastian Pertsch und verkauft seine aufwändigen \"SocialMedia-Charts der Medien\". Auf der re:publica gewähren die Anbieter einen Blick hinter die Kulissen: Wie funktioniert der Einsatz von LaterPay, welche Erfahrungen wurden gesammelt und wie sehen die Perspektiven aus?\n\nGleichzeitig berichtet LaterPay-Gründer Cosmin Ene über die erlebten Rückschläge und die Perspektiven des Micropayment Enablers. Welche Einsatzmöglichkeiten in der Zukunft möglich sind, enthüllt Laterpay erstmals auf der re:publica 2015.\n",

			"title": "Playing with citizens' rights",
			"abstract": "Every day people in Europe face questions and decisions about their rights. So we at European Alternatives thought, let’s play out existing case law to help inform Europeans of their rights and then let’s get onto some curricula across the continent. We believe that by sharing the decision-making processes of people struggling with their rights through board games, role playing games and easy-to-use open source gaming platforms, we can not only inform people of their rights, but also help them to share their own stories and to imagine a Europe where rights protection is possible.",
			"description": "Let’s say you were listed as bankrupt in 2006, or you were involved in a minor traffic accident in 2010, or your political career was nearly ruined by a scandal in 2012. You can forget about these things, your friends can forget about these things, but the search engines won’t. What happens when this is affecting other aspects of your life? From getting a job, to buying a house, to furthering your career? These questions challenge us to ask what it means to be a citizen, and what it means to have rights in Europe.\n\nEuropean Alternatives is a coalition of activists across Europe working to discover and recreate Europe. Our vision is a Europe where we interact with our rights, our institutions and one another to build a better Europe. But for many the distance between rights and daily lives is so vast that it can seem insurmountable. Gaming is the realm where we can explore our continent as well as what an alternative Europe might look like.\n\nThe one hour presentation begins with European Alternatives’ Amsterdam members Laura and Andrea playing out a game with the audience developed for high school curricula across the Netherlands to teach young Europeans about the the EU. We’ll see how much participants really know about the institutions that govern the region. Then European Alternatives’ Senior Project Manager, Jackson, will project an open-source developed game onto the screen and ask the audience to make some of the decisions outlined in the thesis, to see just how complicated European citizenship is for many.\n",

			"abstract": "To many outsiders Europe has an unimaginably long and colourful history, its inhabitants’ relationships morphing through every complexity known to humankind. Yet more than 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a sizable shadow of mystery still looms where the iron curtain once hung. Belgians and Berliners can know more about bookstores in New York and good coffee in Sydney than where Bratislava or Bucharest even are, nevermind they can be little over three hours drive from their own country.",
			"description": "In 2014, twelve Berliners boarded a sleeperbus as it traversed Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania & Greece, in an attempt to reorient themselves with the continent. With a full schedule of workshops, meetings and events with forward-thinkers, provocateurs and activists throughout eight cities, they found not just some of the most exciting, progressive cities in Europe, but also managed to create a network of like-minded people also wanting to take advantage of technology and the new economies to build the foundations for a very different way of life.\n\nDirector Mikael Brain will screen a rough cut of a documentary on the trip, due for release late 2015, preceded by a brief conversation with the initiators of the 4531km project Andreas Gebhard and Claudia Brückner.\n",

Wie tritt man zum Judentum über? Wo kann man einen Rabbi auch ohne Gemeindemitgliedschaft um Rat fragen? Wie findet man Arbeit und Wohnung in Jerusalem? Und wo gibt es koschere Gummibärchen? Kleine und große Dinge des Alltags eben und nicht alles ist immer nur „jüdisch“. Ganz im Gegenteil.\n\nWerfen wir also einen Blick auf das, was so geboten wurde und noch immer wird.

Und was als kleines \"Na schauen wir mal ob es denn wer lesen will\"-Projekt begann, hat völlig ungeahnte Kreise gezogen.  Mir völlig unbekannte Menschen, kamen auf mich zu, programmierten Plugins und Karten-Layovers, boten Übersetzungen und Vertonungen an, halfen bei Recherche und Nachbereitung.\n\nDieser Vortrag soll anhand des Projektes erläutern, wie es gelingen kann eine Community zu schaffen, die aktiv mitarbeitet. Was sind die Voraussetzungen? Was darf man erwarten? Was muss man selbst beisteuern und wie kann man durch gutes Management die Last auf Freiwillige verteilen? Und was hat das Urheberrecht damit zu tun? \n",

Bruce Sterling sieht in Slow Media die europäische Alternative zu Silicon Valley.

			"description": "Vor 5 Jahren haben wir, Sabria David, Benedikt Köhler und Jörg Blumtritt, das Slow Media Manifest geschrieben. Es hat großes Aufsehen erzeugt, wurde in 10 Sprachen übersetzt. Viele Master- und Doktorarbeiten wurden darüber geschrieben, Kongresse widmen sich weltweit dem Thema, Museen wenden Slow Media Kriterien für die Ausstellungsarbeit an (wie z.B. das Deutsche Museum für seine Ausstellung \"Willkommen im Anthropozän\"). Der Schriftsteller Bruce Sterling sieht in Slow Media sogar den Weg zu einer europäischen Alternative zu Silicon Valley.\n\nIn der Medienwelt ist seither viel passiert - Facebook und Twitter sind an die Börse gegangen, Manning und Snowden haben uns die Spitze des Surveillance-Alptraums gezeigt, und Smartphones sind zum \"First Screen\", zum führenden Medienkanal geworden.\n\nDaher die Frage: Gibt es so etwas wie Slow für Medien auch für die Menschen außerhalb unserer Medien-Filterblase? Ist es nur ein Lifestyle-Etikett oder verbirgt sich hinter Slow Media wie auch hinter Slow Food eine “slowe” Grundhaltung, die sich auch in Verhalten, Entscheidungsmustern und Überzeugungen ausdrückt und damit vorhersagbar wird?\n\nFür Autoren und Publisher ist diese Frage unverändert wichtig. Lohnt es sich, kompromisslos in Qualität zu investieren? Gibt es Menschen, die Medien wertschätzen? Was bewegt sie? Welche anderen Eigenschaften haben diese Slow Media Typen? Zeigen sich mediale Interdependenzen? Werden mediale Erfolge mit dem Konzept erklärbar? Gibt es Zusammenhänge mit politischen, moralischen, kulturellen Einstellungen?\n\n \n\nWir Autoren des Slow Media Manifests haben unter wissenschaftlicher Leitung des Medienforschers Hans Georg Stolz vom Institut für Publizistik der Universität Mainz eine Studie aufgesetzt, die Slow Media in der Gesellschaft auf den Grund geht. Durchgeführt wurde die Studie durch das Marktforschungsinstitut d.core. d.core hat dazu 2.000 Menschen interviewt, die in einer repräsentativen Stichprobe zur Teilnahme an der Studie eingeladen wurden.\n\nHeute wollen wir zum ersten Mal die Ergebnisse vorstellen.\n",

			"description": "Drawing on her experiences as an MI5 intelligence officer-turned-whistleblower who had to go on the run around Europe, as well as her current work as a writer, commentator, speaker and European Director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (www.leap.cc), Annie will be discussing the four current global wars: on terror, drugs, the internet and whistleblowers, and suggesting ways that we, as concerned citizens, can resist.\n\nAfter World War 2 the peoples of the word, collectively reeling from the violence and barbarity, drew up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is a high water mark in civilisation. Since then, at least in the west, we have enjoyed an unprecedented degree of freedom and prosperity. In the subsequent decades further victories were won around equal rights on issues of race, gender, or sexuality. By the 1990s peace appeared to be breaking out around the world, the Cold War was over, and we all lived in an increasingly connected, globalised village. Or did we....\n\nPresident Eisenhower coined the phrase \"the military-industrial complex\". He recognised that conflict was good for business, and this had implications for future security. He was prescient. After the racial war was won in the USA, so they announced the \"war on drugs\" which has disproportionatly hit ethnic communities in America and whole continents around the world; as the Soviet threat receded, so the Islamist threat came to prominance; and as the free flow of information spread over the internet, so the fight-back began with the copyright wars, surveillance, and the crackdown on organisations such as Wikileaks.\n\nThose who speak out about these abuses are now labelled \"the insider threat\" – the fourth war is against whistleblowers. We are now facing the \"military-security complex\" and an unending, if nebulous, war on concepts. In all these wars Europe needs to break away from American hegemony in the interests of all European citizens.\n",

			"description": "Die deutschsprachige Food-Blogosphäre hat sich rasant entwickelt. Ähnlich wie die Mode- oder Reiseblogszene haben sich deutsche Food Blogger professionalisiert und kommerzialisiert. Doch einigen von ihnen ist das nicht genug.\n\nFood Blogger 2.0 sind Aktivisten, Meinungsmacher, Entrepreneure, die mehr posten als bloß hübsche Fotos und pfiffige Rezepte. Sie erzählen die Geschichten zu Produkten, treffen Landwirte und Lobbyisten, regen Diskussionen an und nehmen so Einfluss auf Industrie und Politik. Im Web aktive Foodies sind zu Kuratoren und Sachverständigen geworden, die einer stetig wachsenden Zahl von Followern neue Perspektiven auf ihre Ernährung und Lebensweise geben. Vom bloggenden Bäcker, der durch das Internet eine neue Nähe schafft, bis hin zum Facebook-Aktivisten, der sich für mehr Transparenz und eine andere Agrarpolitik einsetzt.\n\nWir wollen Beispiele beleuchten und fragen: Wie groß ist der Einfluss von Food Bloggern in Deutschland? Was bedeutet das für die Ernährungsindustrie – und was für die alteingesessenen Verlage? Wie sieht die Zukunft der Food Blogs aus? Achja, und was zu essen gibt es natürlich auch.\n\nModeratorin Eva Schulz diskutiert mit\n\nHendrik Haase - Der „Wurstsack“ ist in deutschen Markthallen, Metzgereien und seit neuestem auch immer wieder im Bundestag unterwegs. Als selbsternannter „Verteidigungsminister für das kulinarische Weltkulturerbe“ schaut er der Lebensmittelindustrie auf die Finger und informiert tausende Fans und Follower über neue Gesetze, miese Produktionsbedingungen und Lebensmittelverschwendung in Deutschland und der EU.\n\nMalin Elmlid - Ihr Herzensprojekt Bread Exchange wurde vom Hobby zur Bewegung. Über 1000 selbstgebackene Brote hat Malin mit ihren Lesern bereits getauscht – gegen exotische Zutaten aus aller Welt, Reitausflüge und Hotelübernachtungen, aber niemals gegen Geld. Sogar in Afghanistan bereitete Malin ihren Sauerteig schon zu. 2014 veröffentlichte sie ein Buch darüber, wie ein Backblog die Welt verändern kann.\n\nCarmen Hillebrand – Food Blogger 2.0 sind mit Produktproben, Essenseinladungen und althergebrachtem Social Media-Marketing kaum mehr zu begeistern – im Gegenteil: Im Januar 2015 löste das Facebook-Team von Bertolli mit #Pestogate einen „Dishstorm“ aus. Wie geht die Industrie mit den Foodies um? Was hat deren wachsender Einfluss für sie zu bedeuten? Das erklärt Carmen Hillebrand, Abteilungsleiterin Social Media & Content der Metro.\n",

			"description": "Die meisten Menschen sind überrascht, wenn man ihnen zeigt, wie weit die Technisierung des Körper vorangeschritten ist: Künstliches Gehör, künstliche Netzhaut, gedankengesteuerte Prothesen, die direkt mit dem Gehirn verbunden sind. Cyborg-Technologien – also der Umbau des menschlichen Körpers mit technischen Mitteln – scheinen im Moment zwar nur ein Thema für kranke und behinderte Menschen zu sein, auch wenn eine kleine, internationale Szene von Hackern an nichtmedizinischen Implantaten arbeitet. Dieses Thema mag für uns selbst weit weg sein und der Gedanke an ein Hirnimplantat von Google gruselig klingen: Als Gesellschaft sind wir längt eine tiefe, untrennbare Symbiose mit der uns umgebenden Technologie eingegangen.\n\nDas verleitet zu allerlei Zukunftsprognosen: Mitte des Jahrhunderts soll die „Singularität“ eintreten: der Zeitpunkt, an dem Computer intelligenter sind als Menschen. Viele glauben, dass wir dann den Inhalt unseres Gehirns ins Internet hochladen, um dort als posthumane Geistwesen unsterblich weiterzuleben. Dabei sind solche Zukunftsprognosen kaum mehr ein nettes Gedankenspiel, schon allein weil einfach zu viele neue Erfindungen oder gesellschaftliche Entwicklungen passieren werden, die alles in völlig andere Richtungen lenken, als wir heute denken. Wir sind sind da nicht anders als die Menschen des Jahres 1900, die sich für das Jahr 2000 einen Himmel voller Luftschiffe vorstellten.\n\nDabei leben wir längst in einer „Cyborg-Gesellschaft“, ohne uns individuell als Cyborgs zu fühlen. Viele der Probleme, philosophischen Gedankenspiele und Zukunftsszenarien aus Science-Fiction-Geschichten tauchen schon heute in unserem Alltag auf. Dafür muss sich niemand eine Chip implantiert lassen: Es genügt, ein Smartphone zu besitzen. Wie verändern selbstfahrende Autos, Roboter-Journalismus und Funkzellenabfrage bereits hier und heute die Art, wie wir denken und (zusammen)leben?\n",

Stockpiled and flown in, even getting it through customs, the aid can be hugely expensive.\r\n\r\nWith advances in small scale manufacturing, we have an opportunity to disrupt these traditional supply chains: humanitarian supplies can be made in the field.",
			"description": "This talk will reflect on the experience of one organisation, Field Ready, who used 3D Printing technology to make medical supplies for hospitals in Haiti at the end of 2014. It will share some reflections from that experience that can inform future work. During the presentation, a vision will be shared for a new way of responding to disasters using remote manufacturing - both as a means of meeting urgent humanitarian needs but also of harnessing the skills of affected the people.\n\nThe talk will then outline the beginnings of a new movement inspired by ‘Crisis Mapping’ – the ‘Humanitarian Maker’ movement. Again based on experiences in Haiti, the beginnnings of a new movement will be presented that mobilises the expertise of makers and hackers - wherever they may be in the world - to help people affected by disasters. The concept of a 'Fab Lab in the field' or 'humanitarian maker spaces' will be discussed.\n\nFinally, some thoughts about the meaning of this innovation will be outlined: Is it an example of 'power to the people' meets the 'power to create'? Is it an example of 'massive small change'? And is it an opportunity to redefine the traditional, industrial path of development for the next generation in developing countries?\n",

			"description": "Was wurde 2014 nicht (wieder mal) über deutschsprachige Podcasts diskutiert. Zu nerdig, zu Nische, zu … irrelevant? Die Diskussion entzündete sich Anfang August: Ein SpiegelOnline-Artikel listete zahlreiche Gründe dafür auf, warum Podcasts den Sprung in den „Mainstream“ offenbar immer noch verpasst haben. Eine Ursache machte Autor Ole Reißmann in der geringen Vielfalt aus. Podcasts würden vor allem von Männern gemacht, die sich stundenlang über Technik- und Nerd-Themen auslassen. Aber ist das wirklich so?\n\nDem wollte Nele Heise auf den Grund gehen. Auf Twitter fragte die Medienforscherin nach deutschsprachigen Podcasts von und mit Frauen. Und die Resonanz war immens: Die Liste „Frauenstimmen im Netz” umfasst bereits über 150 Einträge. Eine erste Auswertung der Liste zeigt: nicht nur die Anzahl der Podcasts nimmt zu, sondern auch die Themenvielfalt. In dieser Session stellen wir einige der Projekte vor und diskutieren über die Potenziale von Podcasting. Mit dabei sind: Katrin Rönicke (u. a. Erscheinungsraum Ost, Lila Podcast), Tine Nowak (Kulturkapital), Alexandra Tobor (In Trockenen Büchern) und Sarah Geser (Gameblog.ch).\n\nKatrin wird etwas darüber erzählen, warum komplexe Themenfelder wie Osteuropa und auch Feminismus super in Podcasts rüber zu bringen sind, sehr viel besser vielleicht sogar als in und über andere Medien. Dass sich Podcasts hervorragend dazu eignen, vermeintlich \"trockene\" Sachliteratur einer breiten Zuhörerschaft zugänglich zu machen, zeigt In Trockenen Büchern - wie das funktioniert, darüber berichtet Podcasterin Alexandra. Sarah stellt u. a. die Pixelfrauen vor und diskutiert die Frage, welchen Beitrag Podcasts dazu leisten können, den Diskurs über Gaming-Kultur zu bereichern und vielstimmiger werden zu lassen. Tine wird am Beispiel ihres Podcasts Kulturkapital darüber sprechen, warum sich Bildungs- und Wissenschaftspodcasts besonders gut zum mobilen Lernen eignen - nicht nur durch das Hören, sondern auch durch das Selbermachen.\n\nIn der anschließenden Gesprächsrunde geht es uns um Erfahrungen mit dem Podcasting, z. B. woher Zeit und Geld für Podcast-Projekte kommen, wie sich die Angebote dauerhaft aufrecht erhalten lassen oder welche Rolle die Community rund um die Podcasts spielt. Und natürlich stellt sich auch die Frage, was denn zu tun wäre, um die vielfältigen Potenziale von Podcasting besser nutzen zu können, damit die Podcast-Landschaft insgesamt noch vielfältiger wird.\n",

			"abstract": "Wichtige technische Entwicklungen haben immer unsere Gewohnheiten verändert und wurden zunächst oft mit Skepsis aufgenommen. Selten gab es aber so viele Fragen zu den Auswirkungen auf die seelische Gesundheit wie beim Internet. Der öffentlichen Debatte steht eine Psychiatrie gegenüber, die sich abseits von häufig populistischen Positionen zum Thema „Internet-Sucht“ nahezu gar nicht mit diesem Thema beschäftigt. Wir wollen deshalb an der Charité einen Ort für Interessierte, Betroffene und Psychiater schaffen, um einander zuzuhören und miteinander zu diskutieren. Dieses Projekt soll kurz vorgestellt werden.",
			"description": "Tiefgreifende technische Entwicklungen haben die Gesellschaft nicht nur immer verändert, sondern auch die Gewohnheiten des Menschen gestört. Im Verlauf wurde das vormals Neue dann jedoch nicht nur zur neuen Gewohnheit - man konnte sich einen Alltag ohne gar nicht mehr vorstellen.\n\nNie wurde bei einer technischen Entwicklung jedoch so sehr über die Wirkung auf die seelische Gesundheit diskutiert wie beim Internet. Und die Diskussion über diese Wirkung gibt es in nahezu allen Teilen der Gesellschaft, von breiten politischen Debatten bis zu Auseinandersetzungen über Erziehungsprinzipien in der Familie.\n\nExperten auf diesem Gebiet sollten eigentlich PsychiaterInnen und PsychologInnen sein. Doch dem offenkundigen öffentlichen Interesse steht, zumindest hierzulande, eine akademische Psychiatrie gegenüber, deren Urteil oft nicht von Wissenschaftlichkeit, sondern von der privaten Haltung des jeweiligen Psychiaters oder Psychologen gegenüber Technik geprägt ist. Und psychiatrische Beiträge zum einzigen häufiger kommentierten Thema in diesem Kontext, der „Internet-Sucht“, grenzen mitunter an Populismus.\n\nEin Grund für die Schwierigkeiten, die das Thema der Psychiatrie bereitet, liegt sicher in der Komplexität des Themas – denn wir können nur schwer sagen, was am Internet eigentlich krank machen soll: Ist es das Internet als „Technik“, sind es die gesellschaftlichen Veränderungen durch das Internet oder einfach grundsätzliche Schwierigkeiten des Menschen, der immer schnelleren Entwicklung neuer Techniken zu folgen?\n\nStatt weiter unbeteiligt zuzuschauen, wollen wir deshalb an der Charité einen Ort gründen, an dem Menschen mit Sorgen in Bezug auf das Internet und ihre seelische Gesundheit, ebenso wie die interessierte Öffentlichkeit, zusammen mit Psychiatern und Psychologen diesen Fragen nachgehen können. Bei diesem Vortrag soll das Projekt vorgestellt und diskutiert werden.\n",

			"title": "The Time Travelling Classroom – Alternate Reality Gaming in Primary School",
			"abstract": "Imagine you are a 10 year old at school and it is your first lesson of the day. As your teacher prepares to examine your homework there is a knock on the door. A mysterious parcel is delivered which is revealed to be a miniature time machine. A screen on the machine springs to life and a crazy scientist explains to you that you are his only hope to return to the present. You agree to help and embark on an adventure that will last the entire year. This is how the game begins ...",
			"description": "We care about people in stories because we can relate to them on the basis of our own experiences. But what happens when the story is no longer broadcast in a single direction but unfolds as part of a very personal dialogue? How do you feel when you find out that the people in the story also care about you? What would change if you could send them real objects and they could send objects back to you? What impact does this kind of engagement have on learning outcomes?\n\nIn 2009 I started looking for answers to these questions and with the help of three primary schools, a new kind of learning game was developed: “Professor S.” a location based alternate reality game that transforms a fourth grade classroom into a story driven treasure hunt.\n\nThe story is about an odd couple. Two chaotic but ingenious scientists who have invented a time machine. By accident, they start travelling through time and space with no control over their destination. In their desperation, they ask the kids for help. Every day, they have a new quest for the kids. More than often, the quests lead the kids into their own world and require them to look for clues on the school yard or at the local library. When they have an answer, they report back to the time travellers by sending a message through a website or transmitting objects or video through a bespoke hardware: “The Time Portal”. Thus, learning is put into a real context and for the kids, engaging with the story is extremely motivating. They learn because they want to help the time travellers. Learning goals no longer relate to abstract figures on a report card. The answer to the question “why am I learning this?” becomes obvious: “Because Professor S. needs my help”. The teacher slips into the role of Professor S.: she becomes a storyteller, entering into a completely new and very personal dialogue with her pupils. She guides them through the quests, helping them generate their own unique solutions along the way.\n\nThis talk will examine the answer to some of the questions above and describe the challenges and rewards that accompanied the development process.\n",

He recently published an extensive study on global trends corporate surveillance in the age of Big Data and Internet of Things, based on a comprehensive review of academic literature, news articles and corporate resources.\n\nAt re:publica 2015 he will give an entertaining yet in-depth overview about his research results:\n\nTo what extent do companies really track our daily lives in 2015? How do they aggregate, process and exploit our personal data?\n\tWhat can be predicted from our purchases, phone calls, Facebook likes and other metadata when using state-of-the-art analytics technology?\n\tHow is predictive analytics based on personal data already being used in the fields of marketing, retail, insurance, banking and human resources?\n\tWhich devices and platforms, such as smartphone apps or fitness trackers, are collecting our data? Will the upcoming Internet of Things lead to ubiquitous surveillance?\n\tHow do data brokers and ad networks from all over the world profit from our data?\n \n\nThe societal implications of ubiquitous corporate surveillance could be drastic – from (price) discrimination and social sorting to exclusion of marginalized groups.

			"abstract": "We present different cyborgs in form of a “Quartett“ or revue where always two cyborgs duel with each other according to one parameter. These duels show that the merging of technology and body does not have to follow the logic of entrepreneurial self-optimization. To the opposite cyborgism can offer a space for play, imagination and sweet subversion.",
			"description": "From Babylon 5000 a. d. to 2015 human beings have dreamt about the merging of technology and living bodies. Thus, the cyborg has been a faultline for and an embodiment of wildest imagination throughout history. In our talk we present different historical and contemporary cyborg figures to show that cyborgs and their opponents manifest themselves ever new throughout history. We present these different cyborgs in form of a “Quartett“ or “happy family” where always two cyborgs duel with each other according to one parameter (parameters such as sustainability, scale, transhumanist potential, animality, etc.) While Da Vinci's Lion for instance, has a high sustainability value, Robocop beats the techno-animal in bodily integration.The presentation will feature as diverse characters as the Jewish Golem, the Chimera or Neil Harbisson. We talk about Dick Cheney’s encrypted heart, synthetic biology and cyborgian sexualities.\n\n \n\nEventually, our presentation aims to question contemporary body images and human self-references. We are convinced that cyborgism can undermine seemingly stable categories, such as human-machine, but also human-animal and human-environment relations. In a playful way we want to present forms of cyborgism that go beyond a capitalist self-enhancement phantasies. The merging of technology and body does not have to follow the logic of entrepreneurial performance and valuation. To the opposite it can offer a space for play, imagination and sweet subversion.\n",

			"title": "Digital culture, national identities and democracy in the EU",
			"abstract": "This talk explores the critical role of digital culture in tackling current political challenges of the EU. By transcending national and linguistic boundaries, digital culture not only lays the foundations for a European public sphere, but also challenges traditional narratives of national identity. At a time when nationalism is on the rise and threatening core values of the EU, the future of democracy in Europe strongly depends on the incorporation of digital cultures into political narratives.",
			"description": "Europe is facing one of the most difficult times in its post-war history. It is struggling with strong anti-EU sentiment in member states all across Europe. Nationalist movements are on the rise, increasingly gaining democratically legitimized political power. Culture, always having been a popular reference point for identity narratives, is proving an important lever in anti-EU sentiment. As a result the pluralism of European societies is increasingly contested. Nationalist anti-EU movements play on an alleged threat to national identities, building on a long-standing depiction of the EU as “the Other” that has been fostered not only by EU-sceptics, but ironically also proponents of EU integration. Finding a European narrative that is in synch with the EU’s proclaimed values as well as with electorates’ political choices requires tackling the – potentially dangerous – relationship between culture and identity politics.\n\nThis talk will focus on the relationship between digital culture, national identities and democracy, highlighting elements crucial to the debate about the future of Europe. Digital cultures challenge political narratives of national identity by transcending boundaries. Importantly, they give rise to new public spaces in which politically relevant questions are raised, and in which identity narratives are formed, deliberated and adjusted. They also pose concrete policy challenges in areas such as intellectual property and data protection. And as much as the Internet might give optimists hope of a joint civic understanding, so too does it allow for the emergence of alternative networks that are in strong opposition to the EU and/or the values it stands for. The future of Europe will largely depend on European societies’ ability to publically and democratically distill political solutions to the EU’s many challenges. This talk will outline obstacles and opportunities in shifting to a new narrative that resonates with the EU’s core values. \n",

			"abstract": "Gemeinnützig, investigativ, ohne Medienkonzern im Rücken – so ist das Recherchebüro Correctiv im Sommer 2014 gestartet. Ist Nonprofit-Journalismus also auch im deutschsprachigen Raum angekommen? Ja und nein: Das deutsche Steuerrecht macht es Medien-Startups schwer, die Gemeinnützigkeit zu erlangen. Andererseits haben auch schon vor Correctiv einige journalistische Projekte den Nonprofit-Status verliehen bekommen. Wie das auch anderen gelingen kann, wollen wir in diesem Praxis-Workshop vermitteln.",
			"description": "Investigative Recherchebüros, Watchblogs, lokale Nachrichtenseiten und andere journalistische Projekte werden heute oft ohne Profitabsichten gegründet. Sie sind selbstlos tätig, finanzieren sich durch Spenden – und trotzdem haben sie es schwer, von den Steuerbehörden als gemeinnützige Organisationen anerkannt zu werden.\n\nTierschutz, Kleingärtnerei, Karneval, Amateurfunk – wer sich solchen Themen widmet, kann von deutschen Finanzämtern die Gemeinnützigkeit verliehen bekommen. Die Abgabenordnung, das zentrale deutsche Steuergesetz, führt noch viele weitere „gemeinnützige Zwecke“ auf. Journalismus ist nicht dabei.\n\nDabei ist der Nonprofit-Status entscheidend für den Erfolg vieler Projekte: Zum einen wird Spendern und Lesern damit signalisiert, dass sich das Projekt an einem höheren Ziel orientiert und sich niemand bereichert. Zum anderen natürlich, weil Förderer ihre Spenden steuerlich geltend machen können – und auch die Nonprofit-Projekte selbst steuerliche Vergünstigungen erhalten.\n\nAber auch Medienprojekten kann es gelingen, die Gemeinnützigkeit zu erhalten. Einige erfolgreiche Beispiele gibt es schon. In diesem Workshop wollen wir* zeigen, wie man als journalistisches Projekt erfolgreich die Gemeinnützigkeit erlangen kann. Bringt Eure Projektideen mit – und wir denken gemeinsam darüber nach, ob und wie sie gemeinnützig werden könnten.\n\n*Netzwerk Recherche hat 2014 das Projekt Nonprofit-Journalismus gestartet, um die Debatte über das Thema vorabzubringen.\n",

We will dig a little into this and how modern technologies radically changed the now widely used techniques of trolling. Through the excercises we hope to give the audience a better understanding of how trolling can disrupt everyday life in a productive manner  - showcasing skills of both the old masters and the new. We will tell the tales of how the biggest catch was made and show how the masters presented their prize.\n\nWe also want to give the audience a glimps into the mind of the troller - while some of the more ruthless trollers may have given this sport a bad name, it is often overlooked that many care deeply about their envorioment. For many open comunal spaces a responsible rate of trolling is necessary to sustain a healthy enviroment. Trolling, when done responsibly, will keep the ecosystem in balance.\n\nAfterall, trolling is a fun sport for everybody!\n\nCome join us!\n",

Das finden nicht alle gut, nicht zuletzt die Eskalationen rund um GamerGate beweisen das. Aber es passiert, und... was passiert da eigentlich? Und wie viel davon ist gar nicht so neu, wie es uns oft erscheint?\r\nWie sieht diese Politik aus, die Spiele wahlweise zerstört oder bereichert? Ich möchte einen Blick vor allem auf spannende Indie-Spiele werfen und wie sie Politisches verhandeln. ",
			"description": "Der Vorwurf ist nicht neu: Angeblich haben Politik, Feminismus oder überhaupt ein gesellschaftskritischer Anspruch in Spielen nichts zu suchen und machen sie kaputt. Aber wie viele Spiele kommen überhaupt ganz ohne Politik aus? Kann ein Militärshooter unpolitisch sein, und was bedeutet es, auf immer wieder ähnliche Motivationen und Hintergrundgeschichten zu stoßen? Vor allem aber: welche Entwickler_innen und Spiele werden für welche Art von Politik und Gesellschaftskritik angegriffen und was macht diese Spiele - in all Ihren Unterschieden - aus? Vielen von Ihnen wird gar abgesprochen überhaupt ein echtes Spiel zu sein. Aber sie kommen in einer großen Bandbreite und mit völlig unterschiedlichen Zugängen.und es lässt sich mit großer Sicherheit vorraussagen: Sie werden nicht mehr weggehen.Trotz allem Backlash, trotz Gegenwind und Gewalt.\n\nVideospiele können uns Geschichten erzählen und Charaktere nahe bringen, wie wir das aus anderen Medien kennen, aber durch die Internaktionsmöglichkeiten noch viel mehr erreichen und oft gewinnt eine Aussage erst durch die Spielmechanik an Gewicht.\n\nAuch bei Filmen waren es nicht die Blockbuster, die uns Pespektiven aufzeigten,die vom weißen, männlichen hetero-Mainstream abweichen, und so finden sich hier die interessanten Geschichten oft bei den sogenannten Indies. Wir entdecken die erste Liebe eines queeren Mädchens und verzweifeln an den Anforderungen, denen ein Grenzbeamter in einem autoritären Staat gerecht werden muss, wenn wir nicht gerade als Lehrer im Jahr 2027 die Privatsphäre unserer Schüler_innen jonglieren oder langsam, aber stetig in eine Depression rutschen.\n\nJa, Spiele können \"einfach nur Spaß machen\". Sie können Identifikationsmöglichkeiten bieten, auch für Menschen, die sich in den bisherigen Rollenangeboten nicht wiederfinden. Und sie können noch viel mehr.\n\nSchauen wir uns also einmal genauer an, wo und vor allem wie sich Politik und Gesellschaftskritik in Spielen finden lässt!\n",

			"abstract": "An increasing number of researchers and science enthusiasts are pushing for a greater openness in science and research. Yet, Europe severely lacks policies to enable such a shift as governments still trail behind researchers’ and citizens’ demands for openly accessible and usable scientific knowledge. How can we, Europeans, change this and make science more participatory?",
			"description": "Opening up scientific knowledge and research processes is yet to gain the same popularity as opening up software. Yet, a more transparent and participatory scientific research is not just a nerd's latest fad. Opening up science is the only means to ensure reproducibility, ethics and faster progress.\n\nDuring this session, the concepts of open and citizen science will be addressed through the lenses of European policy making. A special attention will be drawn to the access to publications and research data, and what challenges we as Europeans face when trying to opening them up. With privately held editors enclosing publicly funded research productions, opening up scientific publications equates to restoring everyone’s right to read. We thus wish to engage participants in a constructive discussion aiming at improving relevant European policies.\n\nWe intend to build upon efforts deployed by researchers and civil society to open up scientific knowledge and to address the possible ways through which anyone can get involved in advocating for better and more progressive policies.\n",

Darüber hinaus erscheinen immer mehr Produkte von Drittanbietern und Nachrüstern am Markt, die die als geschlossenes System konzipierte Fahrzeugelektronik mit dem Internet verbinden. Selbst absichern kann man sich nicht; abschalten lassen sich die Systeme nämlich oft nicht.  Diese Syteme lassen Autos nicht nur zum Ziel von Hackern werden, sondern sind auch wahre Datenkraken, die fleißig Daten für den Hersteller sammeln.

			"description": "On the first day of my new job, I contributed program code that went live to the website we are building. After a month, I contributed some code that caused alerts. I felt bad and it was reverted quickly, never making it to the site. Still, I was surprised about how my colleagues reacted. They did not blame me! I felt support. These people have got my back. I experienced that it is okay to make mistakes and people trust me to fix them. After my years in gradschool this was a refreshingly new experience! Just two weeks ago, somebody within the company received the annual prize, our three-armed-sweater, for the most spectacular way to bring down the site. We joked that if somebody does not break the site to get the prize, they are not daring enough in their coding. I am still nervous when pushing new code to the site, but it feels like an exciting anticipation and respect for my work.\n\nPeople working with complex systems know they are brittle, because they are complex. Code that works well is nice, but working code also means everything is done - how boring! Programmers and builders live in a constant state of things-not-quite-working-yet, pushing this boundary every day. Even though it might be just software, this can be a challenging environment.\n\nProgramming culture is rife with stereotypes of lone-wolf coders. On hacker news, people like to \"well-actually\" each other. I did it, and maybe you do it too. Quite often, we face our coding questions all alone. With computers, we fight unforgiving machines, and usually the mistakes in our systems are based on human decisions. Programming in pairs and code reviews are techniques to improve these decisions by adding an extra set of eyes and opinions. These tools are excellent to use when working on a challenging complex system together and are known techniques by now.\n\nBut what about the quality of human interaction?

			"title": "Die Jugendplattform von ARD und ZDF: eine Chance für die Netzöffentlichkeit",
			"abstract": "Die Politik hat ein öffentlich-rechtliches Jugendangebot im Internet beschlossen. Die Anstalten, die auf ein trimediales Angebot um einen TV-Sender hingearbeitet hatten, sind noch dabei sich zu neu zu sortieren. Damit öffnet sich ein Zeitfenster, in dem wir grundlegend fragen können: Was kann Grundversorgung vom Netz aus sein? Was ist Public Value in einer von partikularen Interessen bestimmten Netzöffentlichkeit? Welche Verantwortung hat eine öffentliche Institution im Ökosystem des Internet?",
			"description": "Im Oktober 2014 hat die Ministerpräsidentenkonferenz ARD und ZDF mit dem seit Jahren diskutierten Jugendangebot beauftragt, aber nicht als TV-Sender mit Radio und Internet drumrum, sondern als reine Internet-Plattform – ohne Sendungsbezug, ohne Drei-Stufen-Test, ohne Depublizierung nach sieben Tagen und mit einem Etat von 45 Millionen Euro.\n\nDass die U30 dort angesprochen werden, wo sie sich vorwiegend informieren und unterhalten, scheint offensichtlich, stellt aber einen mutigen medienpolitischen Paradigmenwechsel dar: den Bruch mit dem Primat des linear gesendeten Programms und der Sekundarität von Online aka Telemedien. Mit der Jugendplattform ist die Verbindung zum Massenmedienmodell gekappt. Grundversorgung ist im Netz angekommen.\n\nDas ist ein großer Schritt für den Rundfunk, aber auch eine Riesenchance für die vernetzte Öffentlichkeit. Die besteht aus einer unermesslichen Vielfalt von Stimmen der unterschiedlichsten Richtungen, Interessen und Radikalisierungsgrade. Darin bieten nur die von uns Bürgerinnen und Bürgern beauftragten, bezahlten und kontrollieren Medien die Chance, im öffentliche Interesse zu recherchieren und zu berichten.\n\nNicht umsonst fordert Markus Hündgen, Veranstalter des Deutschen Webvideopreises, ein öffentlich-rechtliches Youtube. Andernfalls müssten wir im zunehmend wichtiger werdenden audiovisuellen Wissensraum des Netzes auf journalistische, edukative und künstlerische Inhalte verzichten.\n\n„Internet ist Dialog, Fernsehen ist Monolog,“ schreibt Hündgen. Der erste Schritt ist daher, diesen Dialog mit der Netzgemeinde und vor allem den 14-29-Jährigen zu eröffnen, damit die Jugendplattfom kein Angebot für, sondern mit der Zielgruppe wird.\n\nWie kann eine originär vom Netz aus konzipierte Grundversorgung aussehen? Wie kann die Plattform zu einem Ort für zuverlässige, vertrauenswürdige Informationen werden? Wie kann sie aktive und kritische Medienkompetenz fördern? Was kann sie mit Aufklärung und gutem Beispiel für ein offenes Internet tun, für Netzneutralität, Suchneutralität, Datenschutz, Technologieneutralität, Breitbandausbau und freie Netze? Und was können wir dazu beitragen?\n\nDie Debatte ist eröffnet.\n\n \n",

			"abstract": "How does the contraceptive pill embody colonialist violences aimed at controlling and assimilating gendered bodies, and how might this change or evolve in the future? \r\n\r\nFrom the silphium of the Roman Empire to the birth control pill, contraception has always been a deeply political subject, where sexual freedom, colonialist fantasies and oppressive understandings of gender all mix into a poisonous brew. This session investigates pharmacological contraception and its profound connection to how we perceive, create and perform gender, proposing a discussion on how might the management of fertility and the economy of hormones in our bodies change in a near future.",
			"description": "The session will depart from a brief overview of the legal status, social impact and political implications of pharmacological contraceptives throughout history. We will discuss issues like the thin, blurry line between early-term abortion and contraception before the 20th century; how midwives were responsible for passing on oral knowledge about reproductive health, and their persecution by the State and the Church; or how medical research and technological advancements have both helped develop effective and reliable contraceptives, and promote a narrow, strictly biology-based understanding of how gender works. We will examine how a colonialist mentality has shaped the development of hormonal birth control, how it erased indigenous knowledges on contraception, and how it might continue directing the development of pharmacological contraceptives in the future.\n\nWith the goal of collaboratively creating an account of the possible paths for pharmacological contraception in the next years, this session will immerse participants in a speculative, future timeframe  instead of asking them to approach the subject through a removed, present-day perspective. Current events, as well as imagined futures, will be presented since the beginning of the session as facts of a not-so-distant past, and participants will be encouraged to observe and discuss them as if in hindsight; therefore, a certain suspension of disbelief will be necessary. The session will try to highlight the heterogeneity of people’s relationships with contraception; departing from an analysis of their individual experiences, participants will be asked to approach the subject by writing, abstracting, speculating and performing their future selves.\n",

			"title": "Code + Ethik = ",
			"abstract": "Seit zwei Jahren wissen wir, dass Geheimdienste alles über uns wissen. Seit einem Jahr sind Programmierlernbefürworter an allen Ecken anzutreffen. Und 2015? Müssen wir endlich darüber sprechen, dass Code ohne Ethik wertlos ist. \r\nDer Talk will die Motivation hinter der derzeit angesagten Forderung nach „Programmieren als Pflichtfach“ sezieren, einen Blick auf aktuelle Lehrpläne der Informatik werfen und außerschulische Orte für Programmierwillige vorstellen.",
			"description": "Die nächste Generation von Programmierer/innen sieht sich mit einer ganzen Reihe von zum Teil widersprüchlichen Anforderungen konfrontiert. Die Wirtschaft verlangt nach gut ausgebildeten Angestellten, die gleichzeitig den Innovationsgeist des Silicon Valley nach Deutschland bringen sollen, die Bürger/innen wollen Privatsphäre (und Facebook) - und den Staatstrojaner muss ja auch irgendwer schreiben. Am Ende sind es die Programmierer/innen selbst, die über Funktion und Wirkung ihrer Werke bestimmen. Es ist somit immens wichtig, nicht nur die technischen und beruflichen Interessen der nächsten Generation von Programmierer/innen zu fördern, sondern sie auch für die gesellschaftspolitische Wirkung ihrer Arbeit zu sensibilisieren. Denn Code ohne Ethik ist wertlos. Aber wie vermittelt man diese Ethik der nächsten Generation? Und wie sinnvoll ist in diesem Kontext die Forderung nach einem Pflichtfach \"Programmieren\"? Welche Interessen werden hier politisch verfolgt, und wie lässt sich eine Ethik des Programmierens innerhalb schulischer und außerschulischer Lernkonzepte implementieren? Klar ist, dass Deutschland, was die Förderung der Programmierfähigkeiten von Kindern und Jugendlichen angeh,t im internationalen Vergleich nicht besonders gut abschneidet. Deutlich macht dies ein Zitat des Bildungsforschers Wilfried Bos zur neuen ICILS-Studie: \"Hierzulande lernen Schüler den Umgang mit Medien trotz Schule\". Obwohl Informatik in vielen Bundesländern schon als Schulfach eingeführt worden ist, lohnt sich also ein genauer Blick auf die Lehrpläne. Deren Qualität und die darin vorgesehene Vermittlung von Programmierfähigkeiten schwanken immens - und in den wenigsten ist eine Integration von ethischen Fragen vorgesehen. Wie sehen bestehende Konzepte oder best practice- Beispiele im schulischen und außerschulischen Kontext aus? Was kann man aus ihnen lernen? Und wie lässt sich feststellen, ob all diese Bemühungen überhaupt bei den Jugendlichen ankommen? Gibt es Methoden, um die Sensibilisierung von Kindern und Jugendlichen für ethisches Programmieren sichtbar zu machen? All diesen Fragen möchte der Vortrag nachgehen, um die Ethik des Programmierens stärker in den Mittelpunkt der aktuellen digitalen Bildungsdebatte zu rücken.\n",

			"abstract": "Now, why should I care about nodes and edges? Because they are the underlying operating system of our coordination and the common factor in new social technologies, ranging from the World Wide Web to Google, Facebook, and most probably the next big thing. I like to show you how graphs surround us everywhere and how computational social science and data visualization can help us to understand complex dynamics in Bitcoin, crowdfunding, economies, movies, startups and soccer teams.",
			"description": "While the world becomes more complex and hyperlinked, graph theory and network visualization help us to understand the nervous system of the networks we are embedded into, everyday. Often, the hidden network is the key to understanding a complex system and its seemingly unconnected elements. Thanks to graph analysis, we can condense complex und unstructured data into beautiful images of nodes (points) and edges (lines). Those images of connections are like a \"window to the soul\" of a network, enabling us to approach following questions:\n\nHow can we make the invisible visible? \n\tCan we measure connectedness?\n\tWhat are the physics of social networks?\n\tWhat can we learn from analyzing networks?\n \n\nIn this talk, you will be introduced to a few interesting and entertaining examples of applied graph theory and data visualization. You will see what e-mail communication patterns can tell about a startup’s success, how product complexity explains inequality among countries, how patient communities can improve their knowledge about new therapies, how emotions on Twitter reflect Bitcoin trading activities, how soccer teams differentiate in their passing patterns and how crowdfunding networks help to understand the innovative capacity of a city. As an entertaining finish, Moviegalaxies will be presented, a website that visualizes the hidden beauty of social networks within your favorite movies.\n",

At MIT’s International Development Innovation Network (IDIN) we are developing  approaches to innovation and development that shift the focus from ‘design for’ or ‘design with’ to design by people living in poverty.\n\nWe will draw from a series of global case studies to illustrate the impacts of enabling people to become active creators and stewards of affordable, high-impact technologies, rather than just passive recipients or users of technologies. We will discuss the transformational experience of becoming an innovator as well as the process of creating local affordable technologies, including community water testing and treatment systems, human powered agricultural processing machines, medical and assistive devices for improved health, and clean-burning cooking fuels made from waste.\n\nWe will also share with you the challenges that these innovators face to ensure the viability and replicability of these gains beyond the “aha” design moment. We will introduce you to numerous sustainability strategies that we are experimenting with, including supporting local innovators and local hubs, developing connections to global networks, democratizing communication, and lowering costs to failure.  This approach continues to be iterated, researched and implemented in dozens of communities and at local innovation centers we support in Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Zambia, Nepal, India, Brazil, Sierra Leone, Kenya and Guatemala.\n\nAt the end of our session will invite you to put on your design hats to help us crowdsource ideas on what kind of support ecosystem is needed for local innovation to thrive.\n\n \n\nThis session is part of the GIG programme.\n",

			"title": "Better games through playful design",
			"abstract": "Games are the most important cultural form of our current century. Games also promise us to help us solve the large problems we are faced with. Why then haven't they done so yet? What are we doing wrong? Or are games not as good as they were promised to be? We think games can help us address the complex issues of our time but to do this they have to be better and different. In this talk I'll explain how.",
			"description": "I am part of Hubbub, a studio for playful design. We have recently published a game called Bycatch that we think is a good example of a different way of doing things. Bycatch is a simple card game about two issues that we think are very important: drone warfare and surveillance.\n\nThe game we made, Bycatch, is different in many respects but most importantly:\n\nIt does not tell players what is right or wrong. We think this is patronizing and players will directly understand that they aren't being taken seriously. We want people to think about the issues themselves and make up their own minds.\n\tThe actions you take in the game and the issues it is about are closely aligned. Games are often reduced to a label to put on something boring to try to make it fun. In Bycatch you surveil other players by taking a picture of their cards with the camera function of your mobile phone.\nWe call the process how we made Bycatch “playful design” and we think it is the best way to approach games and play as creators. Bycatch was made in an unorthodox process spanning six months and taking place in Berlin, Utrecht, Brooklyn and London. I'll explain how this positively influenced the end result and the lessons we learned in producing an entire physical game remotely.\n\nOver the course of this talk we'll cover the diverse fields of gamification, serious games, newsgames and games for change and try to redeem them. Games can be applied towards issues and games can be fun but above all, games are in the service of play.\n",

			"description": "Die ersten politischen Entscheidungen für den Ausbau digitaler Kommunikationsinfrastrukturen sowie eine systematische Digitalisierung der Gesellschaft erfolgten in den 70er und 80er Jahren. Wie in Deutschland üblich, wurde alles sehr genau geplant. Wenngleich die Nachfrage nach privat verfügbaren Anwendungen erst noch zu schaffen war, wollte man eine Netzpolitik aus einem Guss - analog zum Eisenbahnausbau ging man davon aus, dass der Infrastrukturausbau zu einer Menge neuer Geschäftsmöglichkeiten führen werde, Pilotprojekte und Technikfolgenabschätzung begleiteten die Diskussion. Unter den Stichworten \"sozialer und ökologischer Kosten\", also (analog zu anderen Technologien wie der Nukleartechnologie) externalisierten gesellschaftlichen Kosten wurden Probleme wie Datenschutz, Überwachung und Rationalisierung der Arbeitswelt thematisiert und brachten Studien hervor, welche Ihresgleichen suchen. Ziel dieser Studien war die Gestaltung des Prozesses, die \"sozial vernünftige\" Implementation entsprechender Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien. Das Ergebnis: Die systematische und durch entsprechende Prozesse unterstützte Ausblendung und Delegitimierung aller Argumente, welche den industriellen Forderungen nach einer \"technologischen Vorwärtsstrategie\" sich auch nur kritisch annäherten. Man befand sich ja in einer Wirtschaftkrise. Irgendwann in den 90ern verschwindet die Diskussion.\n\nWas heißt das für die Diskussion um die Vorratsdatenspeicherung oder Netzneutralität? Was heißt das für die Einordnung der digitalen Agenda? Was heißt das für heutige Vorschläge zur Gestaltung einer digitalen Gesellschaft? Der Vortrag bietet eine Reise durch 30 Jahre Netzpolitik(-forschung) und verspricht neue Einsichten in die alte Frage nach dem #Neuland.\n",

Despite the fact that the boys and girls have attended the school for two or three years, many of them are illiterate and more than 50% of boys and girls in most regions of Ethiopia are not able to answer a single simple comprehension question.\n\nTheir ability to read is one of the single most important skills for children to develop, if they are to thrive as individuals and global citizens. Literacy opens the mind of a child to a potential lifetime of learning, personal growth, and critical and creative thinking.

			"title": "Ein Plädoyer für eine Non-Profit Medienlandschaft",
			"abstract": "Das Internet hat die Medienindustrie in die Krise gestürzt. Alle sind auf der Suche nach dem neuen Geschäftsmodell.\r\n\r\nLetztes Jahr kündigt der US Verlag McSweeney an, dass es von einem for-profit zu einem non-profit Unternehmen wandeln wird. In diesem Augenblick wurde mir klar: das ist die Lösung aller Lösungen für unsere Medienlandschaft.  \r\n\r\nNon-Profit Unternehmen fokussieren sich nicht auf Gewinnmaximierung, sie primär der Gesellschaft deren Teil sie sind.",
			"description": "1. Aktuelle Geschäftsmodelle und warum der Erfolg der neuen Medienhäuser trügerisch ist\n\nAlle Medienhäuser stehen vor der Problematik gleichzeitig den Anspruch der Vierten Gewalt im Lande zu sein und von den Geldern derer zu leben über die sie berichten sollen. Dies ist keine neue Entwicklung, die erst mit dem Internet aufgekommen ist.\n\nUm im Detail die Krise des Journalismus zu verstehen, müssen wir die Business Modele dieser Unternehmen verstehen. \n\n2. Non-Profit ist die Lösung\n\nEin wiederkehrendes Element für alle die mit der Buch-, Zeitung oder Zeitschriftenbranche spricht ist der Wunsch der Menschen in diesen Organisationen sich als mehr als nur Geschäftsleute zu sehen, die einen Verlag aus der Finanznot retten müssen. Sie sehen sich als Kulturschaffende und haben einen anderen Anspruch als die Abgesandten aus Silicon Valley.\n\nAn kaum einer Stelle wird dies so deutlich wie in der Auseinandersetzung zwischen Buchverlagen und Amazon. Während für die eine Seite ein Buch nichts anderes ist als eine Verkaufseinheit, wie ein Spiel, Ladekabel oder Windlen, ist es für die anderen vor allem Kulturbeitrag. Wer seine Vertrieb an Dritte abgibt, muss sich damit abfinden in einem Kapitalmarkt tätig zu sein und sich in diesem zu vergleichen. Hier kollidiert der Anspruch des Kulturschaffens mit der Realität des neoliberalen Marktes.\n\n3. Ausblick\n\nEs leicht zu glauben, dass Unternehmen wie Buzzfeed, die viele namhafte Journalisten einstellen die etablierten Medien überleben. Selbst eine New York Times bezieht noch 3/4 ihrer Einnahmen aus Printanzeigen.\n\nDie mit Risikokapital finanzierten “Neuen” müssen sich ihren eigenen Problemen stellen. Den sie stehen unter dem Druck nicht nur profitabel sondern weit über den Durchschnitt hinaus profitabel zu sein. Andernfalls können sie ihre Investoren, die primär aus dem Silicon Valley kommen, nicht zufrieden stellen. \n\nWas muss passieren? Die Flucht aus dem Markt kann ein Befreiungsschlag sein mit dem die Industrie zu alter Stärke zurück findet.\n",

			"abstract": "Modern technology has significantly changed the way we work today. We are now living in an on-demand economy, where workers can sell their time and skills on demand, and companies work with international teams across the globe.",
			"description": "In the 1970s the classic model of work started to change: Communication and technology meant that companies could now export jobs abroad to save money and this resulted in the start of a flexible, rootless workforce. And then we hit the 21st century and to today in 2015 where we are now living in an on-demand economy; an extension to a sharing economy. It’s no longer about the assets you have, but workers can now sell their time and skills, on demand.\n\nIt’s estimated that 1 in 3 employees in the US are freelancers by choice.  Modern knowledge workers are choosing flexibility over security and stability. As a result, employers can now source talent globally; they are no longer restricted by a postcode. This model allows people to work when it suits them and thus balance their work and home lives in a smart way.\n\nFor the employer, this giant pool of resource brings about new innovation and a better quality of product. Tools and smart technologies that effortlessly exchange information between people and across teams solve this issue and allow companies to become truly global. At the same time this technology allows employees to self-educate and become self-reliant.\n\nHistorically, companies created by the industrial revolution had employees that would give up entire careers to work in one company, yet now Google and Amazon report that the average tenure of an employee is 13 months, not 33 years. Freelance workers available at a moment’s notice will reshape the nature of companies and the structure of careers. B2B is no longer a viable model in an on demand economy, rather B2P (business to people) will shape the future of work.\n\n \n",

			"title": "Blurry line between private service and public infrastructure",
			"abstract": "John Gilmore's \"Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it\" might soon stop being one of Internet's defining quotes. Though designed as decentralized - with no single point of control, or failure - the Net caters to services ever more centralized, controlled… and censored. We worry about domains being seized without due process - yet discusses this on centrally controlled, vertically integrated walled-gardens. Private services become public infrastructure, where free flow of ideas takes place… as long as it complies with corporate policy.",
			"description": "It is of great value that the importance of decoupling IP addresses management and the domain name system management from a single state actor has been recognized and that currently there is a strong push towards multistakeholderism in this area.\n\nThere is, however, a secondary emergent centralization happening on the Internet, that potentially can pose a comparable, or even bigger, threat to the interconnected, open and independent nature of this global network.\n\nThis centralization is harder to perceive as dangerous, as it is not being actively supported by any state actor; hence, it falls under the radar for many Internet activists and technologists, that would react immediately had similar process been facilitated by a government. It does, however, have a potential to bring negative effects similar to a state-sponsored centralization of infrastructure.\n\nAnother reason for this process to happen unnoticed or for the possible negative effects of it to be depreciated is that it is fluid and emergent on behaviour of many actors, enforced by the network effect.\n\nThis process is most visibly exemplified in Facebook gathering over a 1 billion of users, by providing a centrally-controlled walled-garden, and at the same time offering an API to developers willing to tap-into this vast resource, for example to use it as authentication service. Now, many if not most Internet services requiring log-in as one of their options offer Facebook log-in. Some (a growing number) offer Facebook as the only option. Many offer commenting system devised by Facebook, that does not allow anonymous comments — a user has to have a Facebook account to be able to partake in the discussion.\n\nSimilarily, Google is forcing Google+ on YouTube users; to a lesser extent, Google Search is being used by a swath of Internet services as their default internal search engine (that is, used to search their own website or service). GMail is also by far the most popular e-mail and XMPP service, which gives Google immense power over both.\n\nThese are two examples of services offered by private entities (in this case, Google and Facebook) that had become a de facto public infrastructure, meaning that an immense number other services rely and require them to work.\n\nIf we recognize the danger of a single state actor controlling ICANN or IANA, we can surely recognize the danger of a single actor (regardless of whether it is a state actor or not) controlling such an important part of Internet infrastructure.\n\nRegardless of reasons, why this situation emerged (users' lack of tech-savvy, service operators' want of easiest and cheapest to implement and integrate solutions, etc), it causes several problems for the free and open Internet:\n\nit hurts resillience\nIf such a large part of services and actors depend on a single service (like Facebook or GMail), this in and of itself introduces a single point of failure. It is not entirely in the realm of the impossible for those companies to fail — who will, then, provide the service? We have also seen both of them (as any other large tech company) have large-scale downtime events, taking services based on them down also.\n\nit hurts independence\nIn the most basic sense, any user of a service based on these de facto infrastructures has to comply with and agree to the underlying service (i.e. Facebook, Google) Terms of Service. If many or most of Internet services have that requirement, users and service operators alike lose independence over what they accept.\n\nit hurts openness\nOperators of such de facto infrastructures are not obliged to provide their services in an open and standard manner — running mostly in the application layer these services usually any attempts of interoperation. Examples include Twitter changing their API TOS to shut-off certain types of applications, Google announcing the planned shut-off of XMPP server-to-server communication, Facebook using XMPP for the internal chat service with server-to-server shut-off.\n\nit hurts accountability and transparency\nWith such immense and binary (\"either use it, or lose it\") control over users' and other service providers' data, de facto infrastructure operators do not have any incentives to share information on what is happening with the data they gather. They also have no incentives to be transparent and open about their future plans or protocols used in their services. There is no accountability other than the binary decision to \"use it or lose it\", which is always heavily influenced by the network effect and the huge numbers of users of these services.\n\nit hurts predictability\nWith no transparency, no accountability, and lack of standardization, such de facto infrastructure operators can act in ways that maximize their profits, which in turn can be highly unpredictable, and not in line with users' or the global Internet ecosystem's best interests. Twitters' changing of API TOS is a good example here.\n\nit hurts interoperability\nSuch de facto infrastructure operators are strongly incentivised to shut-off any interoperability attempts. The larger the number of users of their service, the stronger the network effect, the more other services use their service, and the bigger the influence they can have on the rest of the Internet ecosystem. Social networks are a good example here — a Twitter user cannot communicate with a Facebook user, unless they also have an account on the other network.\n\nThis is obviously not the case with e-mail (I can run my own e-mail server), at least not yet. The more people use a single provider here (i.e. GMail), the stronger that provider becomes, and the easier it would be for its operator to shut-off interoperability with other providers. This is exactly what Google is doing with XMPP.\n\nit hurts innovation\nLack of predictability, openness and independence obviously also hurts innovation. What used to be a free and open area of innovation is more and more becoming a set of closed-off walled-gardens controlled by a small number of powerful actors.\n\nIt is also worth noting that centralized infrastructure on any level (including the level of de facto infrastructure discussed herein) creates additional problems on human rights level: centralized infrastructure is easy to surveil and censor.\n\nWhen does a private service become de facto public infrastructure?\n\nIt is not an easy question, yet a crucial one to answer. Private forum for a few friends certainly should not be treated as \"infrastructure\", and yet Facebook started of as a private forum for students from a particular college. Where should we draw the line?\n\nWhat should be done about private services that have become de facto public infrastructure?\n\nSeveral possible proposals can be made, including treating such situations as monopoly and breaking them up, or requiring public interoperable API available for other implementators. Each has downsides, and there is no silver bullet. Nevertheless we need to answer this question if we are to keep the Internet free and open for innovation, communication and art.\n",

			"abstract": "NOTES OF BERLIN ist eine Hommage an all die Notizen, die Berlin tagtäglich im öffentlichen urbanen Lebensraum  hinterlässt. Im Fokus stehen dabei Aushänge die ausschließlich private bzw. persönliche Anliegen kommunizieren. \r\nTrotz Facebook, Instagram, Twitter und Co: die urbane, analoge Alltagskulturkommunikation lebt. Der kommunikative Bürger nutzt seine Stadt als Plattform um sich mitzuteilen, mit Stift und Papier. Wir zeigen Euch ein Best Of aus 4 1/2 Jahren skuriller, kreativer und höchst amüsanter Zettelwirtschaft! In einem Best-Of stellt der Gründer von Notes of Berlin die besten Notes vor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
			"description": "Hierzulande ist Berlin das Mekka der Zettelwirtschaft. Berlin spricht mit, Berlin spricht zu uns. Berlin spricht eine, Berlin spricht seine eigene Sprache. Zu jeder Zeit und überall. Berlin will sich mitteilen, etwas erzählen, verzapfen, kommentieren, suchen oder finden und sich manchmal einfach nur wichtig machen. Ob an Ampeln, Stromkästen oder Bäumen, in Hausfluren, Copyshops oder Cafés, in U- und S-Bahnhöfen, oder an schwarzen Brettern der Universitäten: die Hauptstadt zeigt hier ihre vielen Gesichter. Ein Sammelsurium unterschiedlichster Weltanschauungen, von Zugezogenen, Eingesessenen, Hoffenden, Verzweifelten, Träumern, Wahnsinnigen. Glücklichen und Suchenden.\n\nDie Zettelkommunikation ist günstig, schnell und einfach umzusetzen. Sie bietet enorme Gestaltungsfreiheit und die Notes sind mehr als nur reine Informationsträger. Sie sind Vermittler aktueller sozialer Realität und offenbaren dem Betrachter einen sehr persönlichen Blick auf bzw. in die Seele der Stadt.\n\nNOTES OF BERLIN versucht anhand der NOTE-Fundstücke den Charakter der Hauptstadt einzufangen: Wie ticken die Leute hier, was beschäftigt wen, wo, wie und warum, sprich, welche Sorgen, Probleme, Wünsche und Sehnsüchte trägt der Berliner in/mit sich?\n\nDas Blogprojekt versteht sich als digitales Sprachrohr für die urbane Alltagskulturkommunikation in der Hauptstadt und ist als Gemeinschaftsblog angelegt: jeder kann mitmachen und seine NOTES einsenden.\n\n \n",

			"description": "Smart phones, computers, tablets, email and social media accounts, in short the internet has become an integral part of our everyday lives. We search for things we want to know, read any newspaper we are interested in, plan and arrange travel and keep in contact with our entire network. On the surface all these actions look innocent, we do them everyday. However, below the surface there is a complex spider web of companies which make money out off all these actions. These are also known as data brokers.\n\nThe data broker industry is everywhere and yet it is opaque and hard to see. At Re:Publica 2015 we will present Tactical Tech's research on the data brokering industry and what this means for the user and political actors. More specifically we will zoom in on a test case: Google.\n\n'One account for everything'.\n\nGoogle's tag line sounds nice. No need to worry about your passwords, Google will take care of it. However, when we move beyond seeing Google as a provider of Gmail, Google search or even Google Analytics and lift the veil of the company the tag line does not seem so innocent anymore. Google is one of the biggest data brokers in the world, it makes over 100 million dollars a day, and all this is earned out of our data. With this money Google is expanding fast onto new horizons. Here the company is finding new ways to gain more access to our data. The purchase history of Google shows how their interest have moved from online data to more specific human data: behavioral data.\n\nMany people in Europe don't appear to be very concerned by this, as they feel protected by the notion of privacy frameworks. Next to national legislation, there is the European Union Privacy directive and European Safe Harbor framework. However, all this means very little in light of the obsessive collection disorder of the data industry.\n\nThrough our lecture, we will demonstrate what it means if people have one Google account for everything. In a visual and exploratory way we want to take the participants on a journey to discover this data industry and what this means for our privacy. We also explore some of the alternative strategies to become less dependent on Google.\n",

Konkret und direkt handeln, unabhängig und flexibel bleiben, interagieren, experimentieren und aktivieren, um gemeinsam Perspektiven zu schaffen und in Dialog zu treten inmitten einer hoch komplexen und aufgeheizten Debatte.\r\n",
			"description": "Durch die Verknüpfung von Design, Bildung und Wirtschaft möchte CUCULA neue Möglichkeitsräume für den Einzelnen und für die Gesellschaft schaffen. Als Designmanufaktur, Bildungsprojekt und Plattform für interdisziplinären und interkulturellen Austausch setzt sich das Projekt mit gesellschafts-politischen und kulturtechnischen Fragen auseinander. Durch die Erprobung des Modells versuchen wir neue Wege zu finden, um gegebene Strukturen zu hinterfragen und Alternativen zu formulieren.\n\nUm Utopien den Sprung in die Realität zu erleichtern, brauchen wir die “Abbildung eines realen Vorscheins“ – so schon die Theorie des Philosophen Ernst Bloch. CUCULA ist so ein „Vorschein“: Im Gegensatz zur theoretischen Debatte über die Situation von Flüchtlingen in Europa, wollen wir eine pragmatische und unmittelbare Praxis des Handelns umsetzen und gleichzeitig eine neue Willkommenskultur erproben.\n\nIn Form eines kleinen Betriebes - ein Unternehmen von und für Flüchtlinge – möchte CUCULA durch die Fertigung bekannter Möbelklassiker von Enzo Mari ganz konkret reale Ausbildungs- und Arbeitsmöglichkeiten für Flüchtlinge schaffen.\n\nNeue Medien und deren Möglichkeiten der Kommunikation sowie gesellschaftliche Beteiligung spielen eine wichtige Rolle. Nicht zuletzt das Crowdfunding hat es uns ermöglicht die individuellen Erfahrungen der Geflüchteten mit einer breiten Öffentlichkeit und darüber hinaus mit einem funktionierenden Geschäftsmodell zu verbinden. \n\nDurch die täglich enge Zusammenarbeit mit Geflüchteten lernen wir viel über die Erfahrungen, die Bedürfnisse und den Antrieb des Individuums. Diese Betrachtung im Kleinen und in Verbindung mit den grossen Herausforderungen angesichts der aktuellen Flüchtlingsströme nach Europa, lässt uns die Fragestellungen an die Union in neuem Licht sehen. Es zeigt wie schwierig es für Menschen aus anderen Kulturkreisen ist, unter dem Stigmata des Flüchtlings, in dieser heterogenen Gruppe der Eurozone anzudocken und wie hoch der Grad der Abschottung ist.\n\nWelche Position nimmt die EU im Zuge dieser globalen Wanderung ein? Fördern wir Abschottung oder Willkommenskultur?\n\nInwieweit kann Europa als „Festung“ sich dieser vollziehenden Zivilentwicklung standhalten?\n\nUnd welche Chancen und Möglichkeiten birgt diese Entwicklung?\n\n \n",

The width and depth of this open mindset is unprecedented.

			"description": "Everybody is worried about the ongoing loss of privacy. Nobody cares about the loss of public-ness.\n\nYet without private spheres there is no public sphere. Paradoxically the public sphere only can be maintained when there are private spheres. The loss of privacy leads on to the loss of public-ness.\n\nOnce there was great hope that new forms of public life would emanate from Information and Computing (IC) systems. One thought that the “digital public” would replace all previous forms of public life; public places as well as public institutions.\n\nAnd with the success of the Internet of Things (IoT) all what was private is now becoming public. The public sphere in the IoT is on the verge of an “algo-craty”; a society ruled by algorithms and those who owns the computer power to process those algorithms.\n\nIn our lecture we propose a new generation of public institutions that directly addreses this problem and is made possible by the IoT. In these proposed institutions the public sphere is modeled after the great tradition of public gatherings like the Icelandic Altthing, the Iroquois Confederation and the Swiss direct democracy.\n\nThis new generation of public institutions does not have the flavor of public service providers like schools, libraries, museums, theaters, etc. Rather they are like tables in the sense of Hannah Arendt. At these tables, or event-spaces, people meet because they share concerns. The goal of our project is to find new 'tables' that can accommodate the new kinds of challenges we face today, including migration, scarcity of resources, climate warming, pollution, etc.\n\nWe will present three prototypes of this new generation of public institutions:\n\n1.

			"abstract": "Internetnutzer sind nicht länger dazu bereit aufdringliche Werbung im Netz zu akzeptieren. Anstatt auf ihre Nutzer zu hören, reagieren Werbetreibende auf die Ablehnung ihrer Online-Anzeigen mit nur noch penetranteren Werbeformaten. Dies kreiert einen gefährlichen Teufelskreis und eine Bedrohung für das Online-Ökosystem. Um diesen Teufelskreis zu durchbrechen hat Eyeo die \"Initiative für akzeptable Werbung\" ins Leben gerufen und arbeitet somit an einer nachhaltigen Lösung für Publisher und Nutzer.",
			"description": "Der erfolgreichste Werbeblocker Adblock Plus wurde seit 2006 mehr als 350 Millionen Mal heruntergeladen; wöchentlich kommen ca. zwei Millionen neue Downloads hinzu. Aber warum haben Millionen von Menschen Werbeblocker auf ihren Rechnern installiert? Sie verwenden Adblocker, weil sie von den meist blinkenden und laut tönenden Werbebotschaften im Netz genervt sind. Leider bedeutet das Blockieren von Werbung, dass Webseiten ihrer Einnahmen beraubt werden. Zudem sorgt es dafür, dass gute Werbung nicht gesehen wird. Die Erfahrungen von Adblock Plus zeigen, dass Nutzer Online-Werbung jedoch nicht prinzipiell ablehnen. Mit der 2011 ins Leben gerufenen Acceptable-Ads-Initiative setzt sich Adblock Plus dafür ein, einen Kompromiss zwischen Verlagen und Nutzern zu finden. Nutzer können ausgewählte Webseiten und Werbenetzwerke auf die Whitelist setzen, die Acceptable Ads anbieten. Die Kriterien hat Adblock Plus 2011 in monatelanger Arbeit gemeinsam mit seiner Open Source Community erarbeitet. Der Anreiz für Werbetreibende besteht darin, dass Nutzer akzeptable Werbung bevorzugen. Sie wird weniger geblockt und öfter angesehen. Für Advertiser und Publisher liefert der Beitrag von Tim Schumacher Impulse, wie von Nutzern akzeptierte und damit erfolgreiche Online-Werbung aussehen kann.\n\n \n\nPräsentiert von Adblock Plus.\n",

			"abstract": "In 2012, CollageLab launches the one year cycle International Call for Ideas \"Post+Capitalist City\": the first call for ideas that proposes to deepen the common thinking on the way we live our (urban) lives by encouraging the participants to propose not only architectural design, but rather society design. The participants were asked to think of a society based on newly formulated hypothesis and rules taking into consideration the on-going global economical context. \r\n\r\n130 proposals from 36 countries and 2 1/2 years later, it's time to show, talk, reflect and bring the experience a step further.",
			"description": "\n\"Architecture is not simply something physical but a much more complex culture, whose projects are forms of thought that interpret the world\"\n\n- Andrea Branzi\n\n\nPost+Capitalist City, more than a provocative statement, was in fact a powerful creativity trigger. \"Post+\" is a statement in itself that induces a step-by-step creative strategy:\n\n1/ acknowledging and understanding the contextual condition,\n\n2 / getting rid of it by dissociating the constraints linked to that context, accepted as intrinsic condition for our society,\n\n3/ reinventing new constraints to pattern another kind of society through design,\n\n4/ transposing back the creative ideas designed for a hypothetical Post+society into the existing context.\n\nThe results show that in order to expand the possibilities of creativity, one should question what is accepted as being impossible and transform any observed impossibility into a new ground for potential innovation. Post+ assumes and recognizes the existence of the precedent.\n\nToday more than ever, the voices of entire nations claim a societal and political change that would, if applied, have formal consequences on the way we live in the urban environment, from the daily routine to the physical forms of urban landscapes. We - at CollageLab - have an idea of how this future is looking alike! \n\nWe received 130 different proposals from 36 countries. All unique. All designed. All envisioning different aspects of what could be a slightly different society. Some critical dystopian proposals, some naive utopian ones, some extremely concrete ones based on a legal ground, some inspired by the current debate on climate change, some technological ones...\n\nFor re:publica, I would like to present some of the best tendencies and group of ideas that we received within the Call for Idea and launch the second Opus of \"Post+Capitalist City\" that will tend to open the debate beyond the city specialists to writers, philosophers, sociologists, citizen-thinkers.\n",

			"abstract": "Es ist zu erwarten, dass Zukunftsstädte zunehmend von erneuerbaren Energien geprägt sein werden. Zur Integration fluktuierender Energiequellen wie Photovoltaik und Windkraft sind Speicher für die Versorgungssicherheit von großer Bedeutung. Allerdings sind noch viele Fragen zu organisatorischen Aspekten offen. In unserer Präsentation schlagen wir die gemeinschaftliche Nutzung von Energiespeichern vor und gehen dabei sowohl auf Vorteile als auch auf mögliche Hindernisse bei der Umsetzung dieser Modelle ein.",
			"description": "Der steigende Anteil erneuerbarer Energien an der Stromerzeugung und die damit verbundenen Produktionsschwankungen zeigen, dass zur Gewährleistung einer stabilen Versorgung in der Zukunft Energiespeicher benötigt werden. Obwohl in vielen Lebensbereichen im Zuge der Digitalisierung der Trend zur Share Economy beobachtet werden kann, finden vor allem Heimspeichersysteme für Einzelhaushalte im sich entwickelnden Markt Absatz. Als Grund kann gesehen werden, dass bisher keine tragfähigen Modelle für die gemeinschaftliche Nutzung existieren und im Hinblick auf Eigentümerschaft und Netznutzung noch viele Fragen offen sind. Ähnlich zum Carsharing hätte die gemeinschaftliche Nutzung stationärer Energiespeicher aber zahlreiche Vorteile, deren Realisierung durch die zunehmende Digitalisierung bei den Verbrauchern und im Energiesektor möglich werden wird.\n\nIn unserer Präsentation schlagen wir Modelle zur gemeinschaftlichen Nutzung vor und untersuchen diese. Solche Modelle, wie sie z.B. in Form von Energiegenossenschaften bereits in der Stromerzeugung verbreitet sind, würden die Beteiligung einzelner Personen an einem gemeinsamen Speicher ermöglichen. Verglichen mit Modellen, in denen ein Energieversorgungsunternehmen einen Speicher auf Quartierebene betreibt und besitzt, teilen demokratische Gemeinschaftsmodelle den nicht zu unterschätzenden Vorteil von Einzelspeichersystemen: Die Beteiligten haben das Gefühl, elektrisch unabhängig zu sein, da sie selbst für ihre Energieversorgung zuständig sind. In unserer Präsentation diskutieren wir die bei der Implementierung auftretenden Hindernisse am Beispiel eines Pilotprojektes. Daraus leiten wir wichtige Implikationen für die Netzpolitik ab und zeigen Vorteile einer höheren Flexibilität bei der Nutzung des Stromnetzes auf. Darüber hinaus geben wir einen Ausblick für die weitere Erforschung von fortgeschrittenen digitalen Geschäftsmodellen mit erneuerbaren Energien in Städten der Zukunft.\n",

			"abstract": "With 21st century mobility reaching its spatial & ecological limits, systemic changes are mandatory. Taking inspiration from natural systems, Biomimicry renegotiates the relationship between mobility & the urban space on the three levels: product, infrastructure & use. Creating a just-in-time system that increases the utilization rate of urban vehicles & infrastructure and allows for an individualization of use. Such a system will transform the static station-based concept of public transport into a dynamic traffic landscape and free valuable urban space for alternative uses.",
			"description": "Nature has figure it out: Birds never collide when quickly changing directions in huge swarms. Ants always find the most efficient path to a food source. And even single-celled organisms like slime molds build transport networks that outcompete our subway systems.\n\nAt the same time, we are facing complex mobility challenges in a world where urban populations grow and planetary boundaries have been exceeded. Systemic approaches are needed to identify solutions that tackle the limitations of today’s challenges in urban mobility, user needs, and city development. Learning from sectors that successfully operate complex mobility systems is essential to cope with the tasks to be managed in urban settings. Mobility is no invention of mankind but a prerequisite for any form of life. Nature during 3.8 billion years of evolution has developed remarkable strategies for efficient transport logistics. Biomimicry, a design approach that takes inspiration from natural systems, reveals how living organisms and cells organize and realize transport and opens up new ways of thinking. Creating a human-centered systems innovation will transform the hermetic urban morphology into a permeable landscape and free valuable urban space.\n\nThe concept leads to a radical improvement of urban life. It not only reduces car traffic on the surface and increases the transport efficiency but importantly also lifts the quality of the mobility experience for a seamless individual journey and creates novel urban morphologies. Former streetscapes can be transformed into shared spaces of private and public use enabling new qualities of urban life including housing, recreation, and leisure. The biomimetic system fosters social encounters and constitutes an open platform, allowing for the emergence of novel transport technologies, typologies, business models, and importantly social synergies.

			"description": "Mapping Public Intensities – Emerging tools for critical urban practices\n\nThe Mapping Public Intensities group is investigating the capacity of emerging mapping practices not only to experiment with innovative tools for representing socio/spatial configurations, but also to create new politically engaged forms of hybrid, augmented public spaces. We argue that mapping today has significant constructive potential for the commons. On the other hand, techno-enthusiastic visions, magnifying the emancipatory role of ICT, tend to neglect the potential threat to the public sphere and commodification of social interactions. Our project aims to compile an \"Active Atlas\" analyzing and connecting activist-based community mapping projects that propose alternative and critical views of the city of Berlin. The workshop will introduce and discuss a number of current mapping initiatives in Berlin, comparing their approaches, aims and experiences. The invited participants will be: Sharing Berlin (crowd-sourced map seeking to aggregate and categorize initiatives that are representing and actively contributing to the sharing economy in Berlin), INURA New Metropolitan Mainstream (critical, collaborative, international researcher and activism project seeking to analyze current urban trends in a comparative manner), Orangotango Kollektive (activist project using critical mapping as a tool to question dominant perspectives and to support transformative community based activities), GentriMap (public scientific tool identifying gentrification and revealing statistical data at neighborhood level). After a short pecha-kucha-presentation of each project we will open the discussion to the audience to create an atmosphere of open exchange of experiences and ideas. The aim of our workshop is to understand the role of maps in current urban contexts and to generate new perspectives on and suggestions for mapping tools with the capability to promote grassroots activities in our cities.\n\nModeration and organization by the Mapping Public Intensities group: Eleanor Chapman, Lorenzo Tripodi, Stefan Göllner, Carlo Venegoni, Jan Lindenberg (www.m-pi.org).\n\nIlyse Magy will discuss mapping and the intersections of physical and mental space for a city's inhabitants, and how crafting collective experience can begin to knit these together.\n",

How can we find a common language to negotiate the freedoms we want to grant each other in shared urban environments?\r\n\r\nGilly Karjevsky and Sebastian Quack trace the history of regulating public spaces and introduce Playful Commons – an attempt to strike a new deal between administrators and creative users of the city.",
			"description": "”As adults we can bring all those years of power, experience, compassion, all those competencies and strengths, all the stories and histories, all our sophistication and post-pubescent powers into play. We can release the inner-adult.” -Bernie DeKoven\n\nPublic spaces are produced by unique, complex ensembles of individuals and organizations, laws and regulations, informal cultural and political practices, architectures and media ecologies. What practical and regulatory patterns emerge across different geographic, political and cultural contexts? Is it possible to agree on rules for the playful co-production of space?\n\nThe last decades have seen a rise in playful, appropriative practices in the public spaces, ranging from street art to skateboarding and parkour, from flash mobs to urban gardening, from performative interventions to location-based digital games. Often, it is completely unclear if these activities are legal, even when they are drawn upon by marketing strategists to convey the image of vibrant, authentic urban lifestyles.\n\nIn coevolution with these practices, the “wars” against terror, drugs and homelessness have produced tools to intervene against any kind of behaviour that does not fit into predictable consumer culture. Measures against loitering, “Anti-Social Behaviour Orders” and pervasive surveillance have created a situation where governments and administrators of privately owned properties have become “helicopter parents” of every single user.\n\nWith Playful Commons, curator Gilly Karjevsky and game designer Sebastian Quack move the conversation away from fear and towards a positive description of the freedoms we want to grant each other – as mature citizens in a shared environment, taking into account legitimate concerns while allowing play to take place. Building on the idea of Creative Commons, the project aims to create an evolving, modular set of licenses for spaces that can be used playfully – a toolkit for debate, design and regulation.\n",

			"title": "Die symbiotische Stadt",
			"abstract": "Die symbiotische Stadt hat die Anachronismen des Planungsrecht überwunden und statt der Unterteilung städtischer Flächen nach Nutzungstypen eine Unterteilung in Innovationszonen vorgenommen. Wo Wohnen und Arbeiten miteinander verschmelzen, entstehen neue Wohnformen, die dem demographischen Wandel trotzen, etablieren sich bekannte Modelle der shared economy und im public-research-partnership stellen sich ForscherInnen und BürgerInnen gemeinsam den Herausforderungen der urbanen Transformation.",
			"description": "Fast 60 Jahre lang hat die „Charta von Athen“ die europäischen Städte geprägt: die Trennung von Wohnen, Arbeiten und Erholung, ursprünglich der Verbesserung der Lebensbedingungen dienend, hat das städtische Leben kanabalisiert. Keiner bekommt das besser zu spüren, als die Bewohner jener Großwohnsiedlungen im Osten Deutschlands, deren Lebenswelt mit dem Niedergang der hiesigen Industrie zu schrumpfen begann auf 60m² tristem Plattenbau.\n\nIn den shrinking cities entstanden sehr innovative Ansätze wie mit Leerstand umzugehen sei, doch finanziell gefördert wurde vor allem der Abriss. Trotz partieller Quartiersaufwertung bleiben Stadtteile stigmatisiert, gebauter Raum ungenutzt. Die Durchmischung von Gewerbe, Wohnen und Freizeit kommt so langsam voran, wie der technische Fortschritt, der zur Transformation in klimaneutrale Städte notwendig ist, aus den Laboren in die Praxisanwendung. Nur eine symbiotische Stadtentwicklung beschleunigt die Innovation auf nachhaltige Weise. Die Planung erfolgt nicht mehr getrennt in den Ressorts Bauen, Wirtschaft, Wissenschaft und Soziales sondern in einem flexiblen, interaktiven Prozess. Bürgerinnen und Bürger stehen sowohl als Bewohner, als auch als Experten und Produzenten im Focus.\n\nDie symbiotische Stadt ist eine Stadt der kurzen Wege und der lokalen Wertschöpfung, weil Dienstleistung und Gewerbeansiedlung in Wohngebieten aktiv gefördert wird. Der Restbedarf an Mobilität wird intermodal gedeckt: mit (Lasten)Fahrrad, E-CarSharing, Nahverkehr. Gesellschaftlichen Herausforderungen, wie Suche nach nachhaltigen Produktionsstilen und Energiegewinnung aus erneuerbaren Quellen kann vor Ort begegnet werden und wo kommunale Energieversorger keinen Handlungsspielraum sehen, bereichern Bürgernetze den Wärme- und Strommarkt. Herkömmliche Förderinstrumente werden ergänzt durch Urban Crowdfunding. Forschung für Bauen, Mobilität und Energie konzentriert sich nicht mehr auf die Ergebnisse in Laboren, sondern in LivingLabs auf die Präferenzen der Nutzer.\n",

In this session we’ll discuss online identity and anonymity as they relate to the work of online journalists and activists.

			"description": "The decision to mask one's identity online can in some contexts be vital to a person’s protection, while in others it has a limited or even harmful effect. As human rights defenders, we feel we must learn to think more critically and carefully about the value of anonymity in online activism and journalistic work. In this session we’ll discuss this issue and brainstorm a set of guidelines intended to help journalists and advocates more effectively navigate this decision-making process. We will also consider the role of social media platforms in this milieu.           \n\nHowever, in some contexts it can have a harmful and deleterious effect. A recent example of this can be seen in the current situation facing the “Zone9” bloggers, a group of online activists who were arrested in Ethiopia in April 2014 and were charged with trumped-up terrorism offences. According to those who are close to the bloggers, they were working within a regime where police surveillance, both digital and physical, was far too robust to be foiled by an online pseudonym. In this context, anonymity may have promoted freedom of expression, but ultimately put the bloggers at risk of prosecution. This brings to mind the situation of a number of Cuban bloggers who explained why they used their real names in their work: they said that “by writing under a pseudonym, we signal to the state police that [we] think we are doing something wrong.” As a result, they expected to be a more likely, and more credible, target for investigation.\n\nIt is also important to note that police and government surveillance is not confined to totalitarian regimes. Following the Edward Snowden disclosures, cases brought before the European Court of Human Rights seek to argue that the surveillance activities of the United Kingdom amount to a grave threat to freedom of expression. Not least for journalists, who often rely on confidential communications to secure disclosures from those who are most vulnerable. These disclosures are at risk by virtue of the constant monitoring and collection of their communications. In such cases, anonymity is merely a false security.\n\nAs well as potentially having a harmful effect on individuals, anonymity can also destroy credibility. It can be difficult to verify the reliability of the person behind a mask. Whilst, on the other hand, putting a name or face to a piece of information can often increase the newsworthiness and impact of the disclosure. It is much easier for supporters and decision makers to empathise with people when they know their identity and status. Nonetheless, some commentators are beginning to recognise the reputation that can be built around online identities, like pseudonyms. In such circumstances, anonymity can offer security without damaging credibility.\n\nThese cases suggest that as advocates, we must strive to develop a more nuanced understanding of the power and pitfalls of anonymity on the basis of context. We will use this session to discuss the intricacies of this issue and brainstorm some guidelines for individuals navigating this process. We will post the framework on Global Voices (and RP?) and ask for feedback from our broader community. Our hope is to generate a meaningful discussion on the issue that can actually help journalists, advocates, and security experts better understand and navigate this territory hand-in-hand.\n",

			"title": "Das Äußerungsrecht: Von Betrügern, Schmähkritik und zu heißem Kaffee",
			"abstract": "Beim Verfassen von Texten wie beim Moderieren von Posting gilt: Während man eindeutige Beleidigungen meist leicht erkennt, gibt es eine Vielzahl von rechtlich kritischen Äußerungen, deren Problematik auf den ersten Blick nur schwer zu erkennen ist. Das gilt für weniger bekannte Gesetzesvorgaben wie die Kreditgefährdung ebenso wie für Boykott-Aufforderungen oder Schmähkritik. Der Vortrag zeigt Wege durch die Vorgaben des Äußerungsrechts und soll dabei helfen, typische Fallen zu vermeiden.",
			"description": "Die freie Meinungsäußerung ist eines der höchsten Güter des deutschen Rechts. Tatsachenbehauptungen dürfen weitgehend uneingeschränkt ebenso veröffentlicht und verbreitet werden wie Meinungen. Grenzen sind allerdings regelmäßig dann erreicht, wenn die Rechte von Dritten verletzt werden, also etwa wenn die über eine andere Person oder ein Produkt behauptete Tatsache schlicht falsch ist. Ebenso endet das Recht auf die Verbreitung der eigenen Gedanken dort, wo sie in die so genannte Schmähkritik oder schlichte Beleidigungen umschlägt.\n\nDer Vortrag zeigt anhand von vielen praktischen Beispielen die Grenzen von zulässigen Äußerungen, die sowohl für eigene Texte als auch für die Moderation fremder Äußerungen zu beachten sind.\n\nDieser Workshop ist Teil des \"Law Labs\" auf der re:publica 2015.

Kein Wunder, dass Hinweise wie \"Werbung\" oder \"Anzeige\" eher störend wirken und auf sie bei Blogger Relations, Native Advertising, Eventberichten oder Produkt-Sponsoring gerne verzichtet wird.

			"description": "Die Session richtet sich an Blogger, Journalisten, YouTuber, Unternehmen sowie Marketingagenturen.  Der Speaker ist Rechtsanwalt für Marketingrecht und wird seine Erfahrungen aus seiner Beratungspraxis schildern. Die Session wird daher praxisorientiert und anhand von Beispielen erklären wo die rechtlichen Grauzonen bei der Vermischung zwischen redaktionellen sowie werblichen Inhalten liegen und welche Gefahren sie bergen.\n\nEs wird um die notwendigen Kennzeichnungen von Werbelinks, gekauften Blogbeiträgen, Bewertungen, Produktplatzierungen in Videos und Umgang mit Einladungen zu Events gehen. Ferner wird besprochen wer haftet, falls ein Verstoß in Form von Bußgeldern oder Abmahnungen geahndet werden sollte und worauf bei der Gestaltung von Sponsoring-Verträgen zu achten ist. Zuletzt werden auch die moralischen Aspekte beleuchtet und diskutiert, inwiefern diese relevant für die Kundenbindung sind.\n\nDieser Workshop ist Teil des \"Law Labs\" auf der re:publica 2015.

Diese Innovationswelle, mehrheitlich als Bottom-Up und Startup-Bewegung, steht vor den Toren des deutschen Gesundheitssystems, welches eine Top-Down streng regulierte Selbstverwaltungsstruktur ist.

Mit der neuen Wirklichkeit einer digitalen Gesellschaft, in der digitale Innovationen sich regulations- und interessensunabhängig und somit erstmalig radikal nutzer- und nutzenzentriert entwickeln und verbreiten, entstehen für die Akteure und Entscheider des Gesundheitssystems neue Einflussfaktoren, Abhängigkeiten aber auch Chancen für eine bessere und kosteneffizientere Versorgung.\n\nWir erleben 40 Millionen Deutsche, welche über mehr als 10.000 Webdienste und Apps zu Gesundheitsthemen zur Verfügung haben mit aktuell völlig neuen digitalen Gesundheits- und Therapieinnovationen.\n\nWo geht hier die Reise hin?

			"abstract": "Anonymous—a enigmatic protest ensemble that first emerged as an activist force in 2008—has been thrust repeatedly into the media limelight due to a series of high stakes digital protest attacks, stretching from Distributed of Denial Service attacks to high profile hacks. By 2011, Anonymous targeted Fortune 500 corporations and military defense contractors. Mercenary hackers doxed Anons, revealing their identities to law enforcement by publishing their legal names, personal photos, and addresses. Anons started to leak sensitive, classified, or humiliating information. Given the prevalence of cyberware and terrorism rhetoric, it would seem effortless and straightforward for government officials to paint Anonymous as a new breed of dangerous cyberterrorists. Despite a few notable attempts to forge this precise connection, the government has thus far failed in slotting Anonymous into this well worn scaremongering trope; the great majority of news media accounts treat Anonymous not as violent cyberterrorists, but foremost as insurgent digital activists.",

Und jetzt die schlechte Nachricht - bei der Frage, ob Urheberrechte verletzt werden oder nicht, kommt es dem Grunde nach nicht darauf an, ob dies von Privatpersonen oder Gewerbetreibenden ausgeht. \n\nDas Fotorecht berührt allerdings eine Vielzahl von Rechtsgebieten, die in dem Workshop angesprochen werden, das sind neben dem \n\nUrheberrecht (regelt unter anderem, dass der Fotograf Urheber ist und die möglichen Verwertungs- und Nutzungsrechte an dem Bildmaterial) auch das\n\tRecht am eigenen Bild (als Persönlichkeitsrecht der abgebildeten Personen) und das\n\tHausrecht (als Recht der Eigentümer an Gebäuden, die fotografiert werden).\n \n\nZiel des Workshops ist es, dass die Teilnehmer anhand einer Reihe von Praxisbeispielen einen Überblick über zulässige und unzulässige Fotonutzung sowie Verhaltenstipps erhalten.\n\nDieser Workshop ist Teil des \"Law Labs\" auf der re:publica 2015.

With the Internet series “House of Cards”, which promptly received three Emmys without ever being shown on television, as well as numerous other award-winning series such as “Orange is the New Black”, Netflix has made entertainment history. In the process, it has proved that streaming portals too can produce sophisticated content, and that they have become serious rivals to traditional TV programmers.\n\nSince Netflix’s entry into the market, a wave of innovation has swept across the media landscape, and has now reached Germany and Europe too.\n",

Über sie können alle Anwendungen einfach und standardisiert alle relevanten Daten abrufen.\n\nDer Clou dabei: Das komplette System kann beliebig erweitert und mit beliebigen Daten angereichert werden. Da die Schnittstelle OpenSource ist, kann sie auch für andere Konferenzen eingesetzt werden - alle Apps, die diese Schnittstelle nutzen, können dann sofort auch für die weiteren Konferenzen verwendet werden.\n\nIn diesem Workshop wollen wir das System genauer vorstellen, zeigen, wie man als Konferenz mitmachen kann, Fragen beantworten, Feedback sammeln und gemeinsam Weiterentwicklungsmöglichkeiten erarbeiten.\n",

			"description": "Deep Lab was founded to examine how privacy, security, surveillance, anonymity, and large-scale data aggregation are problematized in the arts and society. The Deep Lab is an all women research collaborative who are an international group of new-media artists, information designers, data scientists, software engineers, hackers, writers, journalists and theoreticians. We are engaged in ongoing critical assessments of contemporary digital culture by utilizing code and culture. Members include women such as: Ingrid Burrington, Researcher/Artist, Director of metadata for the Guardian,  Kate Crawford, Principal Researcher Microsoft Research, Visiting Professor MIT,  Julia Kaganskiy, NEWInc Director New Museum, NYC,  Jillian York, EFF and Runa Sandvik, Privacy/Security Researcher, Tor Project.\nThe feedback system built into digital networks necessitates the sharing of information. A problem arises, however, when the distribution of this information conflicts with the notion of scarcity—a core ideological component of the value of cultural objects. Since the principles of global capitalism and government determine value based on data, we are left with a fundamental friction in the distribution and creation of culture or research through digital networks. Deep Lab's research focuses on this contradiction by exploring new modes of interaction.\nPushing beyond the boundaries of ego and affiliation, Deep Lab members may choose to protect their identity at any point through anonymity. Doing so allows group members to remain self-reflexive. In order to pursue experimental research and make cultural contributions sustainable, practices of anonymity lend members an authoritative, collective voice unencumbered by individual fear.\n",

			"abstract": "Are you maximizing your online personhood and leveraging your personal brand for the benefit of your lifetime monetization? And what is the cost to your society and soul for your success? Come hear from a scarred, smiling veteran of personal publishing Justin Hall, widely known as an early blogger and sharer of too many personal stories.",
			"description": "Are you exploiting the Internet? Is the Internet exploiting you? This ever-available microphone creates a social pressure to perform. What is the best use of network communications technology for ourselves and our society?\n\nAmidst all this potential media sharing, perhaps we yearn for role models - or at least someone we know we don't want to follow. Since 1988, Justin Hall has tested the internet's capacity to fill his life with attention, affection and remuneration.  Launched in January 1994, his personal web site “Justin’s Links from the Underground” has hosted explicit accounts of his relationships, personal financial transactions, sexually-transmitted diseases, illicit drug experimentation and pleas for crowdfunding.\n\nHall has worked to be honest in public without hurting people's feelings, and he has failed. His oversharing violated the trust of friends and family, while helping some strangers feel less embarrassed about their own suffering.  Was that a worthwhile tradeoff?\n\nVeering between evangelist, businessman and celebrity Hall has evolved himself to attempt to remain relevant and kind.  During this hour at re:publica 2015, Hall will reveal a few of his online-self-sustaining strategies as well as expose some of his biases as a financially-stable, white cisgender man who found himself online in San Francisco in the 1990s. Hall looks forward to sharing what he's learned in twenty years of http://links.net !",

			"abstract": "Social Plugins, Analytics, Kommentarfunktionen, Landkarten, Werbebanner, Gästebücher, Besucherzähler... Alles Funktionen, die unsere Webangebote aus dem Web 1.0 in eine interaktive und kommunikative Umgebung gehoben haben. Zugleich ist fast jedes Feature datenschutzrechtlich ein rotes Tuch für Aufsichtsbehörden. Deshalb aber auf Features verzichten? Nein! Wie Sie mit dem Thema Datenschutz umgehen und praktikabel Probleme vermeiden können, möchte ich anhand einiger Beispiele zeigen und mit Ihnen darüber diskutieren, wie Ihre Erfahrungen und Vorschläge sind.  ",
			"description": "Von den Grundlagen des Datenschutzes haben wir alle schon viel gehört und zumindest die Mehrheit von uns glaubt auch daran, dass es sinnvoll ist, den Schutz unserer Privatsphäre und der damit verbundenen Daten weiterhin zu fördern. Das, was hierfür jedoch uns Bloggern, den Internet Enthusiasten und Visionären von den Datenschutzbehörden vorgeschrieben wird, ist oft nicht praktikabel und weit entfernt von der Realität. Würden wir dies alles so restriktiv umsetzen, wie es oft seitens der zuständigen Behörden oder der Artikel 29 Gruppe \"vorgeschlagen\" wird, wären wir im Web 1.0 stehen geblieben. \n\nEs anders zu machen, bedeutet nicht, dass wir uns \"neben dem Gesetz\" bewegen müssen, wenn wir zeitgemäß im Internet auftreten wollen. Es bedeutet, dass wir unsere Kommunikation, die Gestaltung unserer Blogs, Apps und Webangebote am Nutzer und dessen Bedürfnissen ausrichten müssen. Die Stimme der Nutzer lehrt uns nämlich, welcher Datenschutz Sinn macht und welcher unsinnig ist. Die Diskussion um die \"Zwei-Klick-Lösung\" ist hierbei das porminenteste, bei Weitem aber nicht einzige Beispiel. \n\nAnhand weiterer Beispiele möchte ich gerne diskutieren, welche Lösungen sinnvoll und rechtlich vertretbar oder bei aktuellen datenschutzrechtlichen Diskussionen vielleicht sogar vollkommen über-/unterrepräsentiert sind.  \n\nDieser Workshop ist Teil des \"Law Labs\" auf der re:publica 2015. Im Law Lab erklären acht Speakerinnen und Speaker die rechtlichen Grundregeln, die beim Publizieren im Netz und in Social Media zu beachten sind. Einen vollständigen Überblick über alle Workshops des Law Labs gibt es hier.\n",

Das Phänomen der „User-generated City“ greift um sich und eröffnet neue Chancen für die Zukunftsstadt, bringt aber auch neue Herausforderungen für das urbane Zusammenleben.",
			"description": "Unser urbanes Leben ist zunehmend digital. Wir nutzen Navigationsinstrumente, kommunizieren in sozialen Netzwerken und das Smartphone ist ständiger Begleiter. In diesem Zeitalter von mobilen Datenströmen und vernetzter Kommunikation findet ein Transformationsprozess statt, der nicht nur die gebaute Stadt, sondern auch unsere Arbeitsweisen und das soziale Miteinander verändert. Denn Digitalisierung bedeutet das exponentielle Wachstum an Daten, die Vernetzung unserer Gesellschaft und neue Formen von kollaborativer Selbstorgansiation.  Die Stadt in ihrem digitalen Format gewinnt daher zunehmend an Bedeutung. Die disruptiven Kräfte des Digitalen bringen neue Herausforderungen und Aufgabenfelder mit sich, bieten aber auch neue Lösungen und Methoden. Unterschiedliche Akteure formulieren dabei ihre Positionen und Visionen für eine Stadt von Morgen. In der Stadt von morgen werden Bürger und Initiativen die informationelle Infrastruktur nutzen, um sich als Smart Citizen in aktuelle Diskussionen einzubringen und selbst Stadt zu machen, die „User-generated City“ zu gestalten. Beispielhaft zeigt sich dies an neuen (sozialen) Bewegungen, wie bspw. Collaborative Consumption, Flash Mobs, Maker-Bewegung, Open Source, Crowdsouring, Participative Sensing und selbstinitiierter Partizipation. \n\nDer Workshop stellt 3 aktuelle Projekte und ihre Akteure vor und möchte mit den Teilnehmern folgende Fragen diskutieren:  Wie begründet sich die Motivation dieser neuen raumbildenden Akteure? Welche technischen Innovationen werden wie genutzt? Wo bestehen Herausforderungen in der Nutzung der technischen Möglichkeiten (z.B. Datenschutz & Big Data)? Wie werden sich Teilhabe und Mitwirkung in der Stadt der Zukunft verändern? \n\n \n",

I believe it is time for the Hackerspaces, iHubs, FabLabs, Makerspaces, of the world to put down our tools and stop writing grant proposals and start asking these questions: \"What should we make?\" and \"Where are we going?\"\n\nSinging with the universe is a metephor about how I answer those questions.

Our possible futures are narrowed down by their bandwidth. We are supposed to just assume that they help us reach the optimal solution to a problem in some mystical algorithmic way. This often hides the fact that behind every algorithm you can find at least one human being who has made intentional and —more often than not— unintentional decisions about its effects.\n\nThe lack of diversity in the industry is therefore harmful: our world is now being designed and regulated through the imagination of white male twenty-somethings living in the Valley. These algorithms used to mostly affect our world as seen through the browser. But today they are starting to affect our non-screen-lives too, because all the physical things around us are becoming computers. Algorithmic regulation is absolute. It is hard to negotiate with a computer and they don't handle exceptions well.\n\nAre we ready for a world where your car won't start if you haven't paid your car loan, will cancel your lease contract if it thinks you are driving recklessly and will refuse to take a route that isn't suggested by GoogleMaps? Your environment is starting to make assumptions about you to be able to personalise your experience. How will you feel once your hotel room picks out a song to welcome you on the basis of the colour of your skin?\n\nThis talk will use fresh and recognizable examples to show why we need to demand transparency for the algorithms around us if we want to have some agency left in the near future.\n",

			"description": "12 November 2014 saw the iconic landing of humankind on comet 67p ‘chury’, at 600 million kilometres distance from Earth. Our heroes were – and still are - two robotic probes, a mothership called Rosetta and a small comet lander, named Philae.  The very same day celebrity Kim Kardashian tried to #BreakTheInternet, but Twitter statistics quickly showed that people were much more interested in #CometLanding - an epic win for (Space) Science!\n\nThe European Space Agency ESA's Rosetta mission may be considered one of the craziest space endeavours ever undertaken: Conceived and approved in the 90ies, implemented over the turn of the millennium, launched in 2004, followed by a ten year journey over 6.4 billion kilometres with arrival and finally landing on a comet. But the mission is far from being over: 13 August 2015 will be the date of Rosetta's closest approach to the sun ('perihelion') and will show the comet in its most active and thus scientifically most interesting phase for Rosetta.\n\nESA Rosetta Flight Operations director Andrea Accomazzo will tell us the story of Rosetta from a scientific and engineering angle while Koen Geurts, DLR German Aerospace Center's Philae Lander technical manager, will outline the complex and critical process of landing on a moving target that has almost no gravity and was – and still is - full of (scientific) surprises.\n\nEqually important is what Emily Baldwin and Karin Ranero Celius will share with us. They represent a small, but very important part of the Communications team behind the mission and will explain how the exceptional use of social media and other means of digital and visual communication, the unique #CometLanding Twitter conversation of @ESA_Rosetta and @Philae2014 did not only help convey complex space science to a larger public (and how it topped Kardashian ...), but also how personalising Rosetta and Philae actually catered for a lot of engagement with the digital society. Marco Trovatello, who works for ESA’s Communication Department, will moderate the session.\n",

			"description": "Jeder einzelne von uns wirkt implizit politisch. Jeder von uns wirkt systematisch an der Realität der anderen mit. So stehen wir 2.0er unter ständigem Publikations- und Verhaltens-Druck: Leaks über Stars oder Regierungen, rassistische oder sexistische \"Witze\", Terror-Propaganda, politische Krisen und emotionale Reaktionen auf Katastrophen - das soziale Netz ist voll von Inhalten, zu denen wir in Echtzeit einen Standpunkt entwickeln sollen und müssen.\nDie ständig bewegten Medien-Gezeiten aus Hypes und Shitstorms lassen uns unserer Rolle als Multiplikatoren nicht entkommen. Zeit für eine neue Ethik des (Nicht-) Teilens?\nIn dieser Session wollen wir die Rollen der drei Akteursgruppen im Medienbiotop analysieren: Unternehmen, Journalisten, User und wie sie „Realitäten“ wahrnehmen und verteilen.\nWer ist wofür verantwortlich? Wir fragen insbesondere uns selbst: Was sollten wir teilen und warum? Wie gehen wir z.B. mit Aufzeichnungen barbarischer Hinrichtungen um, ohne zu Handlangern der Terrormaschinerie zu werden? Wie können wir helfen, die Opfer von Netz- und Hetzkampagnen zu schützen? Und was ist eigentlich mit der Deutungshoheit?\n",

Hack Your Ciy ist ein Projekt des Wissenschaftsjahrs 2015 „Zukunftsstadt“ organisiert von der Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland und Wissenschaft im Dialog gGmbH. Unser Ziel ist es eine aktive lokale Citizen Science Community zu etablieren, in der digitale und analoge Lösungen für reale Probleme der heutigen Stadt entwickelt werden.\n\nDeswegen wollen wir euch in unserer Session zeigen wie sich die Städte wandeln, wollen euch Hack your City vorstellen und euch zeigen wie auch ihr eure Stadt verändern könnt.\n",

			"title": "Serendipity city – informal urban planning and social architecture",
			"abstract": "Pitch: Alfredo Brillembourg: As the world becomes increasingly urban, the demand for decent housing is greater than the supply. Those who can afford living in city centers take advantage of better access to economic opportunities and public amenities. Low-income households are increasingly forced to exit the city to find cheaper housing on the city’s fringes or in suburban agglomerations.\r\n\r\nDiscussion (everybody): What can architects learn from community managers and vice versa about\r\nurban planning?\r\n\r\n",
			"description": "\nThe urban environment is the expression of modern life. Cities grow fast, dynamically and not always in the way governments plan. In particular in developing countries, formal city planning seems to be in a race with informal urban development, settlements like so called slums that may serve the immediate needs of their inhabitants, but clash with the plans of those in power.\nInstead of thinking about urban development as a top-down process, from the drawing board to the street – architects like  Alfredo Brillembourg aim to understand informal urbanism and its effects on the city. With their projects, they embrace the “informal” as a laboratory for the study of adaptation and innovation. \nAlfredo Brillemboourg from Urban Think Tank – a research and design lab concerned with contemporary architecture and urbanism, will present their findings from numerous projects and will discuss with three African innovation hub leaders, from Rwanda, Brazil and Egypt how communities can be involved to make sure the city serves the needs of all its inhabitants. Innovation hubs create nexus points in a city bringing together diverse groups of people - the sum of whose parts are greater than the whole. The idea is to create collaborative spaces for knowledge transfer and serendipitous exchange. Based on their experiences in building and involving communities, \nAdam Molineux-Berry , Jon Stever and Ricardo Ruiz Frere will comment on the work of the UTT and discuss how social urban development can be fostered in both the formal and informal parts of a city.\n \n",

			"abstract": "Social media platforms have taken on a central role in providing fellow citizens and the outside world with critical information in the chaos that surrounds violent conflict, in particular where traditional media sources are censored or unavailable. Access to services such as Twitter offer citizen journalists all over the world an easy and cheap way to share details on events that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. \r\n",

Different sources quote different numbers, confirming what observers already know: that the process of uncovering the human cost of conflict is never straightforward, even in the presence of social media coverage.\nThis talk will: \ndiscuss why violence in conflict sometimes gets reported, and sometimes it is hidden from view \npresent a way to estimate these unreported conflict fatalities using statistical multiple recapture estimation \ninvestigate how changing access to social media affects what we know about killings in the Syrian conflict \ndiscuss the broader implications of how social media shapes our understanding of conflict dynamics\n \n",

This opens a window of oportunity for privacy advocates and ethical hackers to work with early adopters of real-life privacy enhancing solutions and mechanisms, both in the public and private fields.\n\nThe session will present the experience on Eticas Research and Consulting, a company founded by social scientists and engineers that has tripled its workforce in its first year of operation and is currently working with clients in the field of border management, biometrics, social media, emergency management, citizen science or data brokers.\n",

A key feature of futurism is nostalgia and current futurism is nostalgic for the 1950s, a period when potentially unlimited opportunities – in employment, education, public life and private life – opened up for women and were simultaneously shut down. By highlighting the regressive re-sexing of otherwise sterile and egalitarian environments I draw attention to, and expose a number of other false or questionable claims concerning: artificial intelligence; transparency; openness; efficiency; security; autonomy and sustainability. To what extent is the technology of the future all about comfort, care and convenience – and whose comfort, care and convenience are we talking about? Finally, what are the opportunities for intervention when smart means dumb, sterile is sexist and openness is a form of enclosure?\n",

Welche Zukunftsgeschichten werden bereits in der Gegenwart erzählt, welche Formate bestimmen das Feld und ist \"Visual Storytelling\" mehr als ein Trend? \r\n",
			"description": "Alles ist nur einen Klick entfernt, das ist der Fluch und Segen des Internets. Wie lassen sich NutzerInnen an die eigene Marke und Plattform binden, wie lange darf die Leine sein? Facebook will der größte Nachrichtenkanal der Welt werden und statt auf Inhalte nur zu verlinken, diese selbst anbieten. Zeitungsverlage bringt das in ein Dilemma: Reichweite nutzen und an den Werbeeinnahmen mitverdienen oder an eigenen Alternativen arbeiten? Welche journalistischen Formate könnten dadurch entstehen und welche kulturellen Veränderungen zieht das nach sich?\n\nWährenddessen lotet ZDF neo gemeinsam mit Jan Böhmermann aus, wie eine moderne Mischung aus Unterhaltung und Agenda-Setting, sozialen und klassischen Medien aussehen kann. Welche Modelle werden die NutzerInnen am Ende überzeugen und wie schafft es der Journalismus, nicht zur gefälligen Unterhaltungsmaschine hinter Bezahlschranken zu werden?\n\nDas MIZ-Formatfestival 2015 steht unter dem Motto \"Zukunft des Journalismus\" und prämiert vielversprechende journalistische crossmediale Projekte mit Rundfunkbezug. Das von ARTE Future übernommene Gewinner-Format des MIZ-Formatfestivals 2014, FOLLOW THE MONEY, erhielt nach dem Online-Medienpreis 2014 der ERGO Direkt Versicherungen nun den CNN Journalist Award 2015. Wir sind gespannt, auf die nächsten kreativen Piloten!\n\nZuschauer können die Diskussion live im Google Hangout On Air auf der Website des MIZ-Babelsberg und im MIZ-YouTube Channel verfolgen.

			"description": "Der Radius des Radios wächst. Zwischen Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB+), Multicast-Streaming und diversen Plattformen erfinden sich RadiomacherInnen und Sender neu. Neueste Technologien erlauben grandiose Hörerlebnisse und personalisierte Angebote. Es wird lauter beim Buhlen um die Aufmerksamkeit der HörerInnen.\n\nWas braucht der öffentlich-rechtliche Radiomarkt um zukunftsfähig zu werden? Wie kann er mit dem technischen Fortschritt mithalten? Dr. Ralf Müller-Schmid, Leiter von DRadio Wissen, gibt Einblicke in die Selbstversuche seines Senders.\n\nFlorian Fritsche ist Leiter für digitale Unternehmensentwicklung bei Antenne Bayern. Das Privatradio mit der größten HörerInnenschaft Deutschlands. Außerdem saß er in der Jury beim radio.hack, wo sich EntwicklerInnen, ProgrammiererInnen, RadioexpertInnen, WebradiomacherInnen und UnternehmerInnen trafen, um an der Zukunft des Radios zu arbeiten. Eine Idee, die hier entstand ist „SpotiNews“. Personalisierte Musik-Streaming-Dienste werden mit Radionachrichten kombiniert und dem User in gewünschter Frequenz und Länge serviert. Mit-Hacker war Armin Hirsch, Zündfunk-Redakteur (BR), der die Idee vorstellen wird.\n\nIn kompakten Keynotes liefern unsere Gäste Denkanstöße zur Lage der Radiokultur und zu den Erfolgsmodellen der digitalen Hörzukunft.\n\nMehr Informationen zum MIZ_innovationspace@rp15 des MIZ-Babelsberg gibt´s hier.\n",

Heraus kam Jilet Ayse, Fleisch gewordenes Klischee einer prolligen Neuköllner Göre, die auf ihrem Sofa sitzt und über ihre Schwester, die Integrationsnutte herzieht. Auf Youtube hatte die Tirade \"Isch bin voooll sauer!!!\" über 1,2 Millionen Zuschauer. Idil Baydar steht jeden Monat mit ihrem Comedyprogramm in der Bar Jeder Vernunft und wird von Maischberge & Co zu Talkshows über die Integration von Muslimen eingeladen. Nicht alle finden gut, wie Jilet Ayse Stereotypen aufgreift: \"Wir wissen nicht, ob Du Dich über Türken lustig machst, oder über Menschen die denken, Türken sind so!\"\n\nBetül Ulusoy bloggt über Alltagserlebnisse und alltägliche Diskussionen, die sich häufig auf ihr Kopftuch beziehen oder auf ihre dadurch sichtbare muslimische Identität. Sie schreibt darüber, wie es sich anfühlt, wenn sie dazu aufgefordert wird, sich von Terroristen zu distanzieren oder frauenfeindliche Prediger zu verdammen, aber auch von beeindruckenden Schulklassen, die sich durch die Sehitlikmoschee am Columbiadamm führt.\n\nDas Panel gibt Einblicke und Rückblicke in Debatten über Zugehörigkeit und Ausgrenzung in Deutschland und Europa, den Umgang mit Stereotypen und die Möglichkeiten, die das Internet in unserer Gesellschaft Marginalisierten bietet.\n",

			"abstract": "Im Geschäftsumfeld erhält jeder 122 E-Mails am Tag. Nur ein Bruchteil davon ist wirklich wichtig. Über andere Kanäle - soziale Netze, Kurznachrichten, Instant Messaging - kommen weitere Nachrichten hinzu. Die schiere Flut überwältigt. Um wirklich produktiv zu arbeiten, müssen wir umdenken. Lösungen, deren Design an den Wünschen der Anwender orientiert sind, die helfen, Nachrichten gewichten und Aufgaben zu erledigen, in Kombination mit Arbeitsweisen der sozialen Netze, sind der Weg, den Nachrichtenstress zu mindern.",
			"description": "Innovation und E-Mail. Das sind eigentlich zwei Gegensätze, denn seitdem E-Mail populär wurde, hat sich die Art und Weise mit Nachrichten umzugehen, nicht maßgeblich geändert. Nur die Flut der E-Mails steigt rasant an. Parallel dazu werden immer neue Kommunikationskanäle eröffnet. Die Zahl der Nachrichten, aber auch die Anzahl der Kanäle und unterschiedliche Kommunikationspräferenzen unterschiedlicher Generationen sind eine große Herausforderung.\n\nTraditionelle Kommunikationsweisen, der Drang nach Herrschaftswissen und Silodenken prallen auf Arbeitsweisen, wie wir sie aus den sozialen Netzen und von mobilen Endgeräten kennen. Bildlich gesprochen versendet der eine E-Mail-Anhänge und speichert sie lokal, während die andere die Datei über ein soziales Netzwerk offen teilt, \"liked\" und wieder \"shared\".\n\nAus genannten Gründen ist ein Umdenken, eine neue Art zu arbeiten notwendig, dass durch Software unterstützt wird, die endlich dem Anwender bei seinen Aufgaben hilft. IBM hat deshalb mit einer Vielzahl von Kunden und Geschäftspartnern sogenannte Design Camps durchgeführt, in denen gemeinsam herausgearbeitet wurde, wie welche Rolle im Unternehmen gerne arbeiten würde. Dabei herausgekommen ist eine neue Art von E-Mail, IBM Verse, das seit 2. April verfügbar ist.\n\nIm Talk zum #NewWayToWork stellen wir nicht nur die Design Thinking-Methodik vor, sondern zeigen auch, welche neuen Funktionen und Mechanismen von den Anwendern gefordert wurden und wie wir sie umgesetzt haben. Dazu zählen beispielsweise die Integration von Analytics-Funktionen ebenso wie eine klare, an der Nutzung mobiler Geräte orientierte Benutzeroberfläche sowie die Integration von E-Mail und sozialen Arbeits- und Verhaltensweisen. Und darum geht es wirklich: Gute Technologie, die dabei hilft in einer neuen Art mit Informationen umzugehen, und eine neue Arbeitskultur, die auf Transparenz und Zusammenarbeit setzt.\n\nIBM Verse wird auf der re:publica live gezeigt. Wer selbst einen Eindruck gewinnen will, kann sich unter ibm.com/Verse für die Basic-Version registrieren. (Bitte beachten, dass die Freischaltung etwas dauern kann, da derzeit ein großer Ansturm besteht und die Kapazitäten im Rechenzentrum in Frankfurt derzeit erweitert werden. Wenn es brennt, mich bitte direkt ansprechen.)\n\n--------------\n\nDen Talk am 6. Mai um 11:15 Uhr werde ich (Stefan Pfeiffer) zusammen mit Gerhard Pfau halten. Gerhard ist unser Lead für Design Thinking für IBM in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Er wird im Vortrag die Prinzipien von Design Thinking erläutern und wie die entsprechenden Ergebnisse in Produkte wie eben IBM Verse einfliessen. Freut mich unheimlich, dass wir den Talk nun gemeinsam machen.\n\n-------------\n\nPräsentiert von IBM.\n",

Deshalb rufen IBM und die re:publica zum #IBMHack Social Media Hackathon auf. Es geht darum, die pfiffigste Analyse-App zu bauen, die hoffentlich neue und tiefe Insights zum Social Media-Geschehen rund um die re:publica bringt. Als Werkzeugkasten steht dafür IBM Bluemix und darüber die neue gemeinsam von IBM und Twitter geschaffene Twitter API zur Verfügung.",
			"description": "Mit Bluemix hat IBM eine Umgebung geschaffen, in der sich Cloud-basierte Web-Anwendungen und mobile Backends schnell entwickeln, installieren und aus der Cloud betreiben lassen, und das mit einem einfachen Klick auf eine Schaltfläche.. Das Angebot umfasst Werkzeuge aus unterschiedlichen IT-Disziplinen wie Big Data, Social, Mobile, Sicherheit oder dem Internet der Dinge und orientiert sich an unterschiedliche Kundengruppen und -anforderungen wie Mobile Commerce, Wissenschaft und Marketing. Auch neue Geschäftsfelder wie Wearables, also die Entwicklung tragbarer Computersysteme, können von Bluemix profitieren.\n\nDie PaaS-Umgebung Bluemix (Platform as a Service) bietet mehr als 50 Services von IBM und Geschäftspartnern und gehört zu einer der größten Plattformen innerhalb der Cloud Foundry Foundation. In Bluemix ist beispielweise auch IBM Insights for Twitter als Service verfügbar, über den auf live und archivierte Tweets zugegriffen werden kann. Twitter und IBM haben kürzlich eine Zusammenarbeit angekündigt und betreuen unterdessen schon eine Vielzahl gemeinsamer Kunden, die Twitter für ihr Business analysieren.\n\nWir rufen jetzt zur und mit der re:publica 2015 zum #IBMHack auf, um auf Basis von Bluemix schnell und effizient die pfiffigste und aussagekräftigste App zur Analyse des Social Media Buzz rund um die re:publica zu entwickeln. Sascha Lobo war der Top Influencer der re:publica 2014. Er hat – nach dem offiziellen @republica-Twitteraccount – die meisten Retweets und die höchste Impression-Zahl erreicht. Das wundert nicht wirklich. Doch was kann man noch aus dem Social-Media-Buzz herauslesen, der in jedem Jahr anlässlich der re:publica über uns hereinbricht?\n\nHarald Uebele und Helmut Kühbauch geben am 5. Mai eine Einführung in Bluemix und stehen während der gesamten Zeit am IBM Stand auf der re:publica für Fragen zur Verfügung. Die Sieger werden am letzten Veranstaltungstag um 17:30 Uhr von der re:publica und der IBM präsentiert und prämiert. Wer Fragen zum Hackathon hat, kann sich gerne an Harald Uebele (UEBELE@de.ibm.com,  @Harald_U) wenden. Wer mitmachen will, bitte hier registrieren.\n\nTiPP: Wissensvorsprung sichern für den IBM Social Media Hackathon @republica und nehmen am #IBMBluemix Webinar für Hackathonistas am 30.4.2015 von 16:00 bis 17:00 Uhr  teilnehmen.\nAuch hier anmelden unter: http://ibm.biz/Hack-rp15 .\n\nPräsentiert von IBM.\n",

			"title": "Is our online future worth sacrificing our privacy and security?",
			"abstract": "Many business models and platforms powering digital life operate at the expense of privacy. Multinational companies like Google and Facebook already make billions, and are exploring new ways to monetize personal data. But this doesn't seem to be illegal, as users happily pay the price for 'free' services. On the other hand, groups willing to break laws are targeting our online security - including criminals looking for money and governments interested in surveillance and espionage. Are these two issues, privacy and security, jeopardizing Europe’s online future and digital culture?",
			"description": "The Internet is a pretty remarkable thing – particularly the free and open services that we can all enjoy. Unfortunately, most of the products and services marketed as 'free' are far from it. And what's only recently become clear is the value of data as a kind of digital currency.\n\nGiant companies like Facebook and Google have built empires using the data provided to them by their customers - customers that have never given them any money. People use their personal data to pay for digital services. Whenever you agree to a terms of use policy or an end-user license agreement to use a \"free\" service, you're paying for it with your privacy. And now companies are cooperating with one another like never before, finding new business models and new ways to monetize people's personal data. However, there doesn't seem to be anything illegal in that, as end users happily accept any cost to get their 'free' services. On the other hand, groups that target our online security are completely willing to break the law. This includes both the criminals that launch attacks to make money, and the governments that do it for surveillance and espionage purposes.\n\nAddressing concerns about privacy and security aren't easy, but they're too important to ignore. Here in Europe there's a lot of talk about integration and the benefits offered by a single digital marketplace. I'm an optimist, but I understand that such integration will also pose new challenges and expose us to unforeseen risks.\n\nCompanies are talking to each other about how to make more money at the expense of people's privacy. Online criminals are talking to each other about how to develop the digital threat landscape. We need to start talking about privacy and security if we want to see a healthy digital culture develop. And we need to start the conversation now.\n\n \n\nPresented by f-secure.\n",

			"description": " \nSusa Pop: Connecting Cities is a European and worldwide expanding network aiming to build up a connected infrastructure of media facades, urban screens and projection sites to circulate artistic and social content. In opposition to the commercial use of these urban media, we establish them as platforms on which citizens can exchange – within the city as much as between cities. Connecting Cities Network pursues artistic research programmes that combine workshops and conferences with the production of interactive artworks which are presented every year during the Connecting Cities Events. The Connecting Cities Network is initiated by Public Art Lab in collaboration with 24 partners worldwide.\nFrancesca Ferguson : Make City Vom 11. bis 28. Juni 2015 findet in Berlin zum ersten Mal das internationale Festival für Architektur und Andersmachen statt. Das Festival schaut in Hinterhöfe, geht auf die Dächer der Stadt und fragt, ob Hochhäuser von Morgen aus Holz sind. Es blickt zurück auf Elektropolis und nach vorne in Wohngemeinschaften der Zukunft. Neue Formen und Strategien in der Architektur und Landschaftsarchitektur werden kombiniert mit partizipatorischen und zivilgesellschaftlichen Ansätzen des Stadt-Machens. So geht es u.a.: um  1) Urbanes Gemeingut – the urban commons – Urbane Stadtlandschaften und Freiräume. 2) Neue Formen des Wohnen und Arbeiten – Innovativer Wohnungsbau, von Baugruppen bis zu Projekten, die als Wegweiser für eine Mischung aus neuer urbaner Arbeitskultur, Wohnkonzepten und urbanem Leben stehen. 3) Gemeinsam Gestalten – Urban Open Source – Menschliche Ressourcen und partizipative Planungsprozesse, die zu einer nachhaltigen und innovativen Stadtplanung führen. \nOrla Brennan, Aileen Iverson: Entrepreflaneur Architectural Project: Urban totem, Urban Totem is a series of mini-rest stops inserted into the public space of streets and parks, a kind of urban acupuncture connecting the energies of invisible infrastructures though key points along the city’s collective body simultaneously connects global-digital-civic-space and local-physical-public-space. Composed of vertically stacked, digital elements UT offers free amenities: recharging personal digital devices, entertainment (webcam, digital printer), and Internet connectivity. UT is a place to work while participating in or observing local and global social space. UT is a new office prototype: free, accessible, open, public, global, casual, social, individual, communal, the natural habitat of the entrepreflâneur.\n \n \n",

Doch es wäre ein perfektes Leuchtturmprojekt als Zukunftsstadt.

In Germany though the technology has so far not been introduced on a wide level at festivals.\n\nThe panel will talk about the convencience and safety aspects of cashless payment and crowd management and why festivalgoers still might want to opt out of using it. Fruzsina Szep (Director of Festival Coordination and Public Affairs, Hörstmann Gruppe / Melt! Booking) will talk about her experiences with RFID at Hungary's Sziget festival and the plans for this year's German Lollopalooza and Berlin Festival.

Robots have the potential to turn our cities into arable land.

In contrast to this ambition, the technologies used and the operational systems implemented are often invisible and with limited options to adjust to individual needs of citizens. The project “Smart Sustainable District” wants to demonstrate how districts can be shaped by the demands of a variety of neighbourhood members. The pilot area Moabit West becomes a showroom for smart urban planning driven by open innovation and playful collaborative citizens activities.\nRalf Steeg, Juna Grossmann: SYSTEME ZUR VERMEIDUNG VON ABWASSEREINLEITUNGEN IN FLÜSSE, SEEN UND MEERE\nDie Verschmutzung und Zerstörung der natürlichen Recourcen ist eines der wichtigsten Themen unserer Zeit. Wasser ist davon besonders betroffen. Im Bereich der städtischen Wasserkreisläufe ist die weltweit verbreitete Mischkanalisation von ausschlaggebender Bedeutung.

Wie finden Nutzer zu Live-Angeboten?\n\nInhalte sollen und müssen Nutzer dort erreichen, wo sich diese gerade aufhalten: in Social-Streams, in Apps, auf Portalen und natürlich in der Suche. Aus diesem Grund wird die umfassende Präsenz von Medieninhalten auf all diesen Kanälen immer wichtiger. Dazu gibt es unterschiedliche Strategien: vom klassischen Marketing und klassischer Werbung über Crosspromotion bis hin zu intelligenten Partnermodellen oder Social Media. SKY gelingt es erfolgreich, über Marketing und Promotion und natürlich über attraktive Inhalte neue Nutzer zu generieren. Laola1.TV findet reichweitenstarke Partner, die ihre Livestreams just-in-time verbreiten. ESL.tv und Co. setzen auf die Community der Streamer, die ihr Publikum über Facebook, Twitter und YouTube aufgebaut haben.\n\n \n\nVortrag - The good, the bad and the default\n\nFirefox wechselt in den USA zu Yahoo und Google verliert 4% Marktanteil — das ist der größte Rückgang seit 2009. Standardeinstellungen sind enorm wichtig. Dieser Talk handelt von den kleinen (und weniger kleinen) Designentscheidungen, die das Verhalten von Millionen von Usern prägen. Dabei geht es um Verantwortung und darum, Einfachheit und Auswahl im Gleichgewicht zu halten. Philipp Sackl gewährt Einblicke hinter die Kulissen von Mozilla und dem Firefox Design Team.\n\n \n\nVortrag - Neue Wege zu Inhalten: Ist die Dominanz der Suche am Ende?\n\nSocial Networks, Notifications, Messenger, virtuelle Assistenten, Smart-Watches und Sprachsteuerung. Die klassischen Paradigmen der Suche verlieren in diesen Umfeldern schnell an Bedeutung. Inhalte werden nicht mehr gesucht, sondern direkt an die Nutzer gepusht.

			"description": "Vortrag - Das ist Werbung? Content Marketing, Influencer Relations und native Advertising\n\nWerbung in und um Videos im Internet kann vielfältige Formen annehmen. Immer mehr Marken produzieren ganze Formate mit bekannten Protagonisten, um ihre Botschaften zu platzieren. Über Portale lassen sich ab 100 Euro Product-Placements in Videos, Fotos und Facebook-Posts buchen. Influencer mit hunderttausenden Fans, Followern und Abonnenten  werden gezielt vermarktet. Und Medienunternehmen arbeiten mit ihren Werbekunden gemeinsam daran, Native-Advertising-Inhalte zu erstellen, die sich perfekt in das eigene Angebot integrieren lassen. Theresa Grotendorst gibt einen Überblick der neuen Werbeformen und Marketingstrategien.\n\n \n\nSchleichwerbung? Nein danke! Ein Impuls zur Werbeaufsicht auf Videoplattformen.\n\nAngesichts der mannigfaltigen neuen Plattformen, Produzenten und Möglichkeiten wird es immer schwerer, Werbung und Inhalte zu trennen. Damit einher geht, dass die Einhaltung von allgemeingültigen Standards immer schwerer einzufordern ist. Und schließlich kommt hinzu, dass die Unterscheidung in Presse und Rundfunk auf Videoplattformen fließend ist. Das alles sind Gründe dafür, die Verfahren der Regulierung im direkten Austausch mit der Branche zu diskutieren. . Gleichzeitig entwickeln Agenturen und Marken gemeinsam mit ihren Testimonials funktionierende Modelle der Zusammenarbeit und definieren so, wie Werbung und ihre Kennzeichnung in Zukunft aussehen könnte.\n",

			"description": "Vortrag - Snapchat, Instagram, Vine und YouTube. Gibt es für die Jugend Medien jenseits des Smartphones?\n\nKommunikation, Gaming sowie Produktion und Konsum von Fotos und Videos steht für viele Jugendliche im Mittelpunkt ihres Medienkonsums. Dominiert wird das Feld von einer Reihe von Apps: Instagram, Twitter, Vine, Facebook und YouTube vereinen die Jugendlichen, wie es einst die linearen Programme von MTV und Viva getan haben. In diesen Apps wird alles konsumiert, von der Nachricht bis hin zum umfangreichen Tutorial. Franziska von Kempis illustriert den Medienkonsum von Jugendlichen innerhalb und jenseits der populären Apps.\n\n \n\nFlüchtige Jugend. Sucht sie sich ihr Programm selbst oder versagt der Markt?\n\nDer massive Zulauf amerikanisch dominierter Internet-Plattformen, die Jugendliche mit ihren Apps unterhalten und informieren, zeigt, dass sich die Jugend zu helfen weiß: YouTube wird für sie zum Ersatz fürs Fernsehen. Doch während Nischen wie Gaming und Comedy erfolgreich besetzt werden, lassen sich Nachrichtenvideos, Dokumentationen und Nischeninhalte nur schwer originär für YouTube produzieren und darüber refinanzieren. Diese Marktversagen soll das Jugendangebot von ARD und ZDF nun beheben. Dabei gilt es die Jugend mit (TV-)Inhalten zu erreichen, die so zuvor im Netz noch nicht verfügbar waren: eine Gratwanderung zwischen Anspruch und Reichweite.\n",

Das Netz ist in der Gesellschaft angekommen.\nDie großen Herausforderungen stehen damit erst bevor. Die Pioniertage sind vorbei. Statt Internet-Erklärbären geht es mehr und mehr um knallharte Interessenspolitik. Diese dominieren derzeit die vom Untergang der Piraten beflügelten Konterrevolutionäre und deren Partikularinteressen.

			"abstract": "Warum können geflüchtete Menschen in Deutschland nicht einfach in WGs wohnen statt in Massenunterkünften?!\u0003\r\nDas haben wir uns auch gefragt & einen Weg gefunden, das möglich zu machen.",
			"description": "Das Ziel von „Flüchtlinge Willkommen“ ist es, die Kommunikation zwischen Menschen mit verschiedenen sozialen und kulturellen Hintergründen aktiv zu fördern und herbeizuführen. Langfristig wollen wir dazu beitragen, eine offene Gesellschaft zu gestalten, in der eine Willkommenskultur für Geflüchtete und ein solidarisches Miteinander als selbstverständlich gelten. Durch eine gemeinsame Lebensgestaltung von Flüchtlingen und Einheimischen werden Refugees nicht mehr gesellschaftlich ausgegrenzt. Die Initiative „Flüchtlinge Willkommen“ wurde am 18. November 2014 gegründet. Seitdem haben uns über 530 WG-Anmeldungen aus ganz Deutschland erreicht, 29 WGs haben bereits einen geflüchteten Menschen aufgenommen. Österreich ist das erste weitere Land, in dem unser Konzept seit Januar 2015 umgesetzt wird. Derzeit unterstützen wir die Adaption unseres Konzepts in den Niederlanden, in der Schweiz und in Griechenland.\n\nWir sind der Meinung, dass es weitsichtig ist, in eine gemeinsame Zukunft zu blicken! Gemeinsam schließt für uns alle Menschen in Europa ein, auch die die hier Zuflucht suchen. Niemand flieht ohne Grund und Europa ist nicht unschuldig an heutigen Konflikten und wirtschaftlichen Problemen auf anderen Kontinenten. Für uns ist es zeitgemäß, die aus diesem Gedanken resultierende Verantwortung anzuerkennen und alles für ein nachhaltig funktionierendes Zusammenleben innerhalb Europas und der Welt zu tun. Hierfür ist eine neue Willkommenskultur und Offenheit gegenüber Menschen mit anderer Sozialisierung und Herkunft notwendig. Wir hoffen, mit der Initiative \"Flüchtlinge Willkommen\" dazu beizutragen! Gemeinsam mit Bakary, der selbst als Geflüchteter in Berlin ankam, möchten wir neben der Vorstellung unserer Initiative und einem kurzen Einblick in seine persönliche Situation folgende Punkte ansprechen: In welchen Bereichen können wir außerdem zu einer offeneren Gesellschaft und einer Verbesserung der Bedingungen für Geflüchtete beitragen? Wie ist ein privat gelaunchtes Konzept wie unseres übertragbar auf andere wichtige Lebensbereiche, wie zum Beispiel Beschäftigung/Arbeit und allgemeine interkulturelle Kommunikation?\n\nDer Vortrag wird zum Teil auch auf Englisch stattfinden, da Bakary noch nicht perfekt deutsch spricht.\n",

			"description": " \nAnne Weibert: When Ideas Learn How to Fly: Crossing Cultural Boundaries with Geocaching Project Work\nThis study of a geocaching game project in an after-school initiative explores such project work as a means to foster cross-cultural understanding and respect among children in diverse neighborhoods. Main findings indicate that the computer-mediated collaborative activity in geocaching is apt to 1) bridge formal and informal learning contexts, and can thus support individual as well as collaborative learning effects, and 2) support the individual as well as collaborative development of a sense for space and place, and thus the building of a local community.\nIlaria Fioravanti: The future of learning\nSome educators in Germany and elsewhere question whether teaching digital technology to children from a young age is productive. Some say school is not the right place to learn about these digital tools. But educators at Herman-Nohl Schule, a European primary public school (Italian/ German) in Berlin’s troubled Neukölln neighborhood, take a different approach. They are influenced by recent research showing that, for example, multimedia learning is a highly effective way for children to acquire knowledge. That is why the school employs the latest digital tools while at the same time making students aware of the potential, the limitations and the dangers of the digital revolution.\nMichael Schulte: Klexikon.de - Auf dem Weg zu einer \"Wikipedia für Kinder\"\nSehr viele Kinder nutzen die Wikipedia in Schule und Freizeit. Für Kinder geschrieben ist das Online-Lexikon aber nicht. Aus diesem Grund gibt es ein neues Projekt: Klexikon.de, eine Art “Wikipedia für Kinder”. Gefördert wird das Kinderlexikon, das unter CC-Lizenz steht, von Wikimedia Deutschland. Bis Ende 2015 sollen die ersten 1000 kindgerechten Artikel entstehen. In einem Wiki, versteht sich. Und als Weihnachtsgeschenk für alle Kinder im deutschsprachigen Raum.\nDer Journalist Michael Schulte hat sich das Klexikon ausgedacht. Als Projektleiter baut er zusammen mit Freiwilligen auf www.klexikon.de ein kostenloses und werbefreies Kinderlexikon auf.\n",

			"description": " \nOliver Stickel: Making@Palestine\nThrough our long-term research project “come_IN”, we have established a world-wide network of computer clubs for children. Computer-based playful learning and collaborative projects are in the center of all come_IN clubs. Further important goals are integration and bridging the “digital divide”. Most of the clubs are located in Germany, however, two are in Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank. Oliver Stickel and Dominik Hornung, two researchers from the University of Siegen, visited the Palestinian clubs in 2014. They brought a 3D printer and worked with the local children and volunteers on 3D modelling and 3D printing - always minding the come_IN philosophy of playfulness and beginner-friendlieness. In this talk, Oliver will present some of the experiences from Palestine as well as the impressive projects envisioned by the children who never before worked with 3D modelling, let alone 3D printing.\nYsanne Choksey: Allversity\nAllversity is free online platform for young people who want to learn about health, human rights, entrepreneurship and sustainable agriculture. The platform brings together all the best information available on the web to provide courses that are both meaningful and extremely educational. Come along to the lightning talk by Allversity's Implementation Director to find out more about how online learning materials can provide alternatives for students wanting or needing to learn outside the constraints of traditional education.\nSimon Köhl: eine Wikipedia für die Bildung\nIn der Wikipedia, erschaffen Menschen gemeinsam Wissen und machen den freien Zugang zu Wissen selbstverständlich. In der Bildung ist diese Revolution noch nicht angekommen. Das wollen wir ändern: Mit www.serlo.org bauen wir eine internationale Lernplattform, die allen kostenlos zugänglich ist und bei der alle mitmachen können. Unsere Vision ist freie Bildung, die durch eine offenen und unabhängige Gemeinschaft gestaltet wird.\n",

Auf unserer Bühne werden dann fünf Gäste die Dinge öffnen um sie besser zu verstehen, Mängel ans Licht bringen und Alternativen zum Status Quo aufzeigen.\n\nGäste und ihre Themen: Janis Winzer (Murks? Nein Danke!) zu Obsoleszenz, Alex Shure (Open It Agency) zu Open Source Hardware, Johannes Korten (GLS Bank) zu Finanzprodukten, Alice Grindhammer (Open Source Circular Economy Days) zu Müll & Kreislaufwirtschaft, Fieke Jansen. (Tactical Tech Collective) zu Daten.\n\nDurch das Programm führt die Performerin Alicia Augustin als Conférencière.\n\nText und Konzept: Charlotte Knips, Lars Zimmermann, Jürgen Bertling\n\nPräsentiert von der GLS Bank. \n",

			"description": "Granaton: Passiver Widerstand im sozialen Netz – das Pseudonym 3.0\nDas Pseudonym hat in Europa jahrhundertealte Tradition. Auch im postdigitalen Zeitalter ist der Wunschname gesetzlich geschützt. Er kann in den Personalausweis eingetragen werden. Das Finanzamt erlaubt Rechnungen mit Künstlernamen. Banken akzeptieren einen eingetragenen Nom de Plume als Kontokennzeichnung. Die pseudonymisierte Unterschrift ist gesetzlich bindend.\nIm Internet ist der Nickname starkem Gegenwind ausgesetzt. \"Schutz der Jugend in sozialen Netzwerken\" ist ein beliebtes Argument von Gegnern. Zur Trolljagd blasen Onlinemedien gegen anonyme Profile. Der Pseudo wird zum Krawallmacher stilisiert. Studien widerlegen diese Angriffe. Es sind eher zurückhaltende Persönlichkeiten, die ein Pseudonym wählen, um ihre bürgerliche Identität vor Angriffen und der Verletzung ihrer Privatsphäre zu schützen, oder künstlerisch motivierte Talente, die einer individuellen Identität dadurch Ausdruck verleihen.\nDas Motiv für die Verfemung von unserem kulturell gewachsenen Bürgerrecht auf Pseudonymisierung ist in der Monetarisierung unbezahlter Netzarbeit verortet. Je eindeutiger Datensätze einer Person zugeordnet werden können, desto höher ist ihr Wert im Archiv der Informationsfabriken. Nicht zuletzt Google verfolgte Pseudonyme jahrelang und rief öffentlich zur Denunzierung von Fakeprofilen auf Google+ auf, bis durch Gmail, Chrome, Android und weitere Googleprodukte die geräteübergreifende Identifizierung einer Person auch ohne Klarnamenpflicht möglich wurde. Nach wie vor sperrt Facebook Profile, deren Namen nicht „wahr“ erscheinen und verlangt zum Nachweis der Identität Ausweise mit Geburtsdatum und Passfoto. Jedes Profil dieser Welt soll eindeutig einer Person zugeordnet werden können.\nNils Krüger: Spherebox - Ein sicheres Netzwerk für Filetransfer und Kommunikation\nSpherebox ist ein einfach einzurichtendes Netzwerk für sichere Kommunikation und Filetransfer. Es kann anonym genutzt werden und mit einem Klick können beliebige Geräte und Nutzer miteinander verbunden werden. Spherebox läuft auf Desktop- und Mobilgeräte.\nSpherebox ist ein dezentrales Netzwerk, das man nicht konfigurieren und warten muss. Es benutzt Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung und P2P-Technologie für die Übertragung von Dateien.\nMehr Infos unter: www.spherebox.com\nSimon Tennant: Building NSA-proof messaging apps.\nZuckerberg said: “Messaging is one of the few things that people actually do more than social networking.” But if messaging is the future, how do we keep our secrets, secret and still share and communicate?\nThis talk will cover the challenges of how you build secure social and messaging systems: design challenges and technical challenges around not leaking user's data.\nIt will then look at, concrete stepts for designing your next social app while keeping your user's data private.\nThe talk draws on the Buddycloud team's experience of building a secure messaging stack and give examples of some of the secure apps that developers are building.\nMatthias Pfau: Einfache E-Mail-Verschlüsselung stoppt die Massenüberwachung! \nÜberwachung ist allgegenwärtig. Leider haben es sich die meisten Menschen in unserem überwachten Internet bequem gemacht. Der Aufwand sich und seine Daten zu schützen ist Vielen zu groß. Deshalb brauchen wir möglichst einfache Tools, um uns zu schützen. Tutanota ist ein verschlüsselter E-Mail-Provider, lizensiert unter GPL v3. Wir kämpfen für unser aller Recht auf Privatsphäre und freie Meinungsäußerung. Denn das sind die Grundfesten unserer Demokratie! Wir verschlüsseln deine gesamte Mailbox automatisch. Außerdem kannst du ganz einfach Ende-zu-Ende verschlüsselte Mails an jeden deiner Freunde schicken. Das ist ein großer Schritt nach vorn im Vergleich zu Anbietern wie Gmail und GMX, die selbst Daten scannen und zu Werbezwecken nutzen. Jetzt müssen wir nur noch das Problem mit den Metadaten angehen!\nMushon Zer Aviv: AdNauseam\nAs online advertising is becoming more automatic, universal and unsanctioned, AdNauseam works to complete the cycle by automating all ad-clicks universally and blindly on behalf of the target audience. Working in coordination with your ad blocker, AdNauseam quietly clicks every blocked ad, registering a visit on the ad networks databases. As the data gathered shows an omnivorous click-stream, user profiling, targeting and surveillance becomes futile.AdNauseam is a browser extension designed to obfuscate browsing data and protect users from surveillance and tracking by advertising networks. Simultaneously, AdNauseam serves as a means of amplifying users' discontent with advertising networks that disregard privacy and facilitate bulk surveillance agendas.\nOlivier Amar: Your Privacy Matters! OR Reclaim your privacy\nWho cares about Snowden when your private information is being accessed by hundreds of companies and developers with your permissions?!?\nLet's face it, the government will do what they do and keep doing so, We can lobby, we can expose, but for the sake of \"security\" they will continue.\nThat being said, what excuse do the millions of applications that access your information WITH YOUR PERMISSION have? They don't have an excuse and yet, on average just by installing or connecting to 30-50 applications on your mobile phone/tablet or online, you're sharing your information with over 100 companies!\nThat's where MyPermissions comes in. We have and continue to make it easy for you! the user to make conscious and controlled choices about the who can access your personal information.\n",

Millions of voluntary hours, young people active in thousands of events each year. With what impact? We are offering an inside perspective of one of Europe's biggest NGOs in the field, going through the methods we use to involve teens in European political thinking and intercultural understanding and making the case for a hacker mindset when setting out to find Europe.\nWalter van Holst: Adopt an MEP\nIt is hard for European citizens to stay informed about what happens in  the Brussels bubble and how their Members of the European Parliament  fulfill their role of representing the political will of their voters.  Where the traditional media are failing, the internet must step in. We  are launching adoptamep.eu, a project that aims to create a platform for  citizens to stay in touch with their MEPs on digital rights issues.\nLinnea Riensberg & Eva Breitbach: Publixphere \nPublixphere is the space for a fair public exchange about political ideas and opinions. Our users set the agenda. The editorial team supports the free exchange of ideas by providing background information and by reaching out to stakeholders and experts, inviting them to participate. We also organize and accompany events that deal with political questions. It is our goal to foster the free exchange of opinions on european policy issues in a protected space – online and offline. We want to provide our users, specifically young adults, with a platform in which they can develop and express political thoughts and bring these into political processes.\n \n",

			"description": "Christian Bollert: Radios Second Coming – Digitales Audio erobert das Netz\nAudio erlebt eine zweite Welle der Wertschätzung. Gut zehn Jahre nach dem Podcast-Hype hat sich digitales Audio etabliert. Aktuelle Phänomene wie der Podcast \"Serial\" oder Online-Audio in Autos (VW, Ford, BMW) sind Zeichen dafür. Plattformen wie Soundcloud, Spotify oder der deutsche Radioplayer unterstreichen das. Verlage (Die Welt, Süddeutsche, Zeit Online) bauen gerade ihre Audioangebote aus. Die \"Nische\" Audio scheint nach Jahren des Videohypes als interessanter Markt ernstgenommen zu werden.\nAlexander Matzkeit: Wie ich ganz alleine die deutsche Filmblogosphäre erschuf\nKaum jemand interessiert sich für Menschen, die in Deutschland über Film bloggen, weil sie sich selbst nicht füreinander interessieren. Daher wird es Zeit, die deutsche Filmblogosphäre der Welt vorzustellen; sie zu analysieren, zu dissen und zu loben. Einblicke in eine faszinierende Welt zwischen Hoch-, Pop- und Netzkultur, die auch die lästige Frage einschließt, ob man spoilen darf, dass Bruce Willis die ganze Zeit schon tot war.realvirtuality.info\nSebastian Nuss: Wie verfilme ich Netzkultur?\nNetz-Themen sind zwar längst auch im Fernsehen angekommen, aber über Tweets-vorlesen oder Vermelden neuer Späh-Skandale kommen sie kaum hinaus. Wenn doch, werden gerne Herren in dunklen Hoodies vor Laptops gesetzt (Hacker!), manchmal auch ins Berliner Oberholz (so fancy!) oder Matrix-Zeichenketten (Das! Netz!) als Bilder verwendet. Ab und an gibt es hübsch gebastelte Photoshop-Effekte über tippenden Händen auf Tastaturen. Wie verfilmt man eigentlich Netzkulturthemen? Und wie macht man es gut? Wie übersetzt man am besten komplexe Phänomene der Netzkultur und damit einige der wichtigsten Themen unserer Zeit in bewegte Bilder um? Ein Selbstversuch von Wiederholungstätern.\n",

Bernhard Pörksen, Bestsellerautor und Professor für Medienwissenschaft, geht in seiner Keynote von einer zentralen These aus: Wir sind auf dem Weg in eine redaktionelle Gesellschaft, in der jeder Mensch zum Sender geworden ist. Blitzschnell sind Transparenz und Aufklärung möglich – und in rasender Geschwindigkeit verbreiten sich Gerüchte und Falschmeldungen, bilden sich Protest- und Wutgemeinschaften, die mit Schicksalen auf einer weltweit sichtbaren Bühne spielen. Ein Vortrag über die redaktionelle Gesellschaft mit vielen erhellenden, manchmal erschreckenden und auch erheiternden Beispielen.\n\n \n\nWer hat die Macht? Konvergente Medien zwischen Wettbewerb und Kontrolle\n\nDaten sind das neue Öl – Das Geschäft mit Nutzerdaten bringt neue Geschäftsmodelle und Unternehmen hervor und ändert Machtverhältnisse: Inzwischen bauen Google und Facebook als führende Konzerne im Daten-Geschäft zunehmend ihre Macht auch im Medienbereich aus. Die Basis für das Geschäftsmodell vieler Dienste, die den Alltag der User bequemer machen und die Medienlandschaft erweitern, sind erhobene Nutzer-Daten, die nach ganz eigenen und unterschiedlichen Regeln erhoben werden. Studien zufolge würde es 76 Tage dauern bis Internet-User alle AGB und Datenschutzbestimmungen gelesen haben, die ihnen im Alltag eines Jahres begegnen. Die Erfahrung zeigt aber, dass User eher sorglos ihr Einverständnis erklären, damit sie möglichst schnell in den Genuss des Dienstes kommen und damit dessen Bedingungen ungelesen akzeptieren. Erst wenn es Probleme gibt, folgt der Aufschrei.",

			"abstract": "Müssen wir Netzneutralität von den USA lernen? Wohin geht es mit der Netzneutralität?",
			"description": "Keynote - Macht durch Zugang: Müssen wir Netzneutralität von den USA lernen?\n\nNetzneutralität ist derzeit nicht nur in Deutschland der Zankapfel zwischen Internet-Urgesteinen, Unternehmen, Politik und Aktivisten: Während wir hierzulande noch diskutieren, ob tatsächlich alle Inhalte diskriminierungsfrei durchs Netz geleitet werden sollen oder bestimmte Dienste eine Überholspur brauchen, haben die USA die Gleichbehandlung aller Inhalte bereits gesetzlich festgeschrieben. Das ist in den Niederlanden schon länger geschehen, hier gibt es sogar schon erste Urteile gegen Unternehmen, die die Netzneutralität verletzt haben. Gleichzeitig erfreuen sich Zero Rating-Dienste insbesondere in Entwicklungs- und Schwellenländern zunehmender Beliebtheit. Die Frage lautet nun: Brauchen wir Netzneutralität wirklich? Und was passiert, wenn wir auf sie verzichten? Thomas Lohninger zeichnet die Entwicklung des Internets nach, die sich sowohl durch die gesetzliche Festschreibung der Netzneutralität als auch durch den Verzicht darauf in verschiedenen Teilen der Welt ergeben hat. Mit Blick auf gesellschaftliche und ökonomische Implikationen beider Entscheidungswege stellt er den Vergleich mit Deutschland an und welche Auswirkungen verschiedene Entwicklungen auf die Ökonomie und die Medienrezeption insbesondere des Rundfunks haben würden.\n\n \n\nZero Rating & Qualitätsklassen: Wohin geht es mit der Netzneutralität?\n\nDie Idee Einführung von Qualitätsklassen für spezielle Dienste spaltet die Netzwelt: Die Einen sehen in den Überholspuren im Netz den Niedergang des freien Internets, die Anderen ein lukratives Geschäftsmodell, das auch sicherheitsrelevante Aspekte berücksichtigt, wenn es zum Beispiel um die Übertragung von Daten im Gesundheitssektor geht. Das Panel diskutiert Chancen und Risiken von Qualitätsklassen und der Aufweichung der Netzneutralität sowie der nahen Verwandten wie Zero Rating und Sponsored Data. Außerdem wird hinterfragt, welche Inhalte tatsächlich bevorzugt werden sollten, wie dies diskriminierungsfrei umsetzbar ist und wie der Nachweis erbracht werden kann, dass Inhalte nicht zu Gunsten anderer benachteiligt werden und dadurch die publizistische Vielfalt und der Zugang gefährdet werden.\n",

			"description": "Keynote – Die Bedeutung von WLAN für die Nutzung audiovisueller Medien \n\nDie allgegenwärtige Verfügbarkeit von Medieninhalten im Internet wird für immer mehr Menschen zur Gewohnheit. Der Zugriff auf diese Medieninhalte erfolgt zu einem großen Teil über mobile Endgeräte. Dabei ist das umfassende Angebot für mobile Internetnutzer aber Fluch und Segen zugleich: Sie können zwar unabhängig von Ort und Zeit auf On-demand-Plattformen zugreifen, die Volumengrenzen der Mobilfunknetze eignen sich allerdings nicht, um die Inhalte über mobile Endgeräte unbegrenzt zu konsumieren. Für guten Empfang von YouTube, Netflix, Tagesschau und Co. ist schnelles Internet ohne Volumengrenze eine Grundvoraussetzung. An dieser Stelle kommt WLAN ins Spiel: Die allgegenwärtige Verfügbarkeit dieser Technologie – zu Hause und unterwegs – wird die Nutzung von Medieninhalten erheblich verändern. Steffen Meyer-Tippach gibt einen Überblick über die Verbreitung von WLAN in Deutschland und erläutert den Einfluss auf den Medienkonsum.  \n\nVortrag – The Future Role of Wi-Fi Spectrum \n\nWLAN hat eine beeindruckende Erfolgsgeschichte hinter sich: Wurden die lizenzfreien WLAN-Frequenzen 2,4 und 5 GHz in der Vergangenheit noch als Schrottfrequenzen bezeichnet, für die man außer für den Betrieb von Mikrowellen keine weiteren Anwendungen sah, sind sie heute ein wichtiger Baustein einer digitalen Gesellschaft, ein weltweiter Übertragungsstandard für die mobile Internetnutzung. Zukünftig wird WLAN auch nicht mehr nur in Routern, Laptops, Smartphones und Tablets verwendet. Bei der Entwicklung neuer Anwendungsgebiete für digitale Technologien spielt WLAN eine entscheidende Rolle: Ob bei Smart Grids, mobilen Bezahlsystemen oder Sensornetzwerken – Konnektivität wird überwiegend über WLAN-Netzwerke hergestellt. Der Erfolg von WLAN ist ungewöhnlich. Nach wie vor werden hier Frequenzen eingesetzt, die ungeeignet sind, größere Distanzen zu überbrücken oder Hindernisse zu durchdringen. Weltweit wird daher daran gearbeitet, die WLAN-Technologie weiterzuentwickeln und im Rahmen einer effizienten Frequenzregulierung auch in anderen Teilen des Spektrums einzusetzen. Dr. Ben Scott stellt das Potenzial von zukünftigen WLAN-Anwendungen vor und gibt einen Überblick über aktuelle Trends.  \n\nÖffentliche WLAN-Netze im Spannungsfeld von Politik, Wirtschaft und Justiz \n\nDie Störerhaftung ist seit Jahren die Achillesferse der Netzpolitiker und Zankapfel zwischen Nutzern, Urhebern und wirtschaftlichen Akteuren. Im Koalitionsvertrag und in ihrer Digitalen Agenda hatte die Bundesregierung daher angekündigt, die bisherige Regelung zur Störerhaftung zu überarbeiten und so die Verbreitung von FREE WIFI in Deutschland zu fördern. Der darauf abzielende Entwurf vom Bundeswirtschaftsministerium, der eine Änderung des relevanten Paragraphen acht des Telemedien-gesetzes anstrebt und Rechtssicherheit für Betreiber öffentlicher WLAN-Netze schaffen soll, wurde aber von vielen Seiten kritisiert und lässt viele Fragen offen.",

			"description": "Peacekeeping originally described unarmed military observers or the lightly-armed “blue helmets” who support a cease-fire or peace agreement. Today, with a much wider spectrum of tasks, several international and regional organizations – e.g. the EU, African Union or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE – deploy so-called peace operations around the world.\nThe contemporary landscape in which these missions operate has changed dramatically over the last decades. Only recently, a UN Expert Panel has explored how these missions can better confront the dynamic challenges of the 21st century, stating that “no mission can be expected to succeed in today’s complex environments without an ability to innovate and make effective use of technology and no advantage should be withheld from those working for the cause of peace.” (Read the Panel’s full report here.)\nThis session examines how digital media and technological innovation cannot only support post-conflict peacekeeping but also augment the strategies to foster more effective community development, to empower the victims of conflict and to strengthen the challenging process of peacebuilding.\nSpeakers from Rwanda, South Sudan and Iraq will explain how they are attempting to shape the futures of their conflict-torn countries with digital innovation, like for instance the support initiative www.incike.rw using technology to support /INCIKE/, elderly survivors of the Rwandan genocide who lost their families and now have to fend for themselves.\n \nThis session is part of the GIG programme and hosted by ZIF - Center for International Peace Operations\n",

			"description": "We fortunately now live in an era where the importance of encryption for civil society is no longer a matter of debate. Many initiatives exist to introduce encryption as broadly as possible throughout the internet, but quantity may not always be the right metric. It's really easy to get encryption wrong and thus create a false sense of security, particularly for those without the technical knowledge to assess the risks.\n\nGoogle aims to provide everyone with the world’s strongest security and privacy tools. Security and privacy matter to us, we know how important they are to our users, and we work hard to get them right. Stephan will describe some of the approaches — both qualitative and quantitative — that Google has taken in encryption over the years.\n\n \n\nIn Partnership with Google's Security Team.\n\n \n",

			"description": "Laut aktueller ICIL Studie schneidet Deutschland im internationalen Vergleich bei der digitalen Bildung immer noch nur mäßig ab. Wir befinden uns auf Platz 11 von 21 untersuchten Bildungssystemen – direkt hinter Russland. Die vorderen Plätze belegen die Tschechische Republik, die kanadische Region Ottawa und Australien.\n\nInternet, PC und Smartphones gehören zum Alltag der Schüler. Digitale Kompetenz wird aber nicht allein durch Beibringen dieser Nutzung vermittelt, sondern bedarf des gezielten Aufbaus von kreativen Programmierkenntnissen und einer sehr viel tieferen Durchdringung von IT-Grundlagen an Schulen und Bildungseinrichtungen. Dennoch findet IT-Unterricht an Schulen nur in extrem begrenztem Umfang statt. IT-Leistungskurse kommen kaum zustande. Auch die technischen Rahmenbedingungen an Schulen sind oft stark verbesserungswürdig. Mehr als die Hälfte der befragten Lehrer und Schüler bringen daher laut einer BITKOM-Studie ihre privaten, digitalen Endgeräte als Unterrichtsmittel mit in die Schule.\n\nIm November 2014 konnten über 40.000 offene Stellen für IT-Experten nicht besetzt werden - Tendenz steigend. Dieser Fachkräftemangel stellt die Unternehmen nicht nur vor große Herausforderungen, sondern wird schon bald zu einem massiven Hemmniss für die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung Deutschlands im weltweiten Wettbewerb werden.\n\nDiskussionsteilnehmer:\n\nSaskia Esken, Mitglied des Deutschen Bundestag / Ausschuss für Digitale Agenda\n\nMaria Reimer, Projektleiterin Jugend hackt\n\nPeter Ganten, CEO Univention GmbH\n\nModeration:\n\nChristiane Brandes-Visbeck, Journalistin und Kommunikationsberaterin\n\n------------------\n\nIm Anschluss an die Diskussion wird noch der Univention Absolventenpreis verliehen.\n\nUm die Verbreitung von Open Source-Software im professionellen Umfeld voranzutreiben, hat Univention nun zum achten Mal den Univention Absolventenpreis ausgelobt. Der Absolventenpreis 2015 wird von Univention gestiftet, die Gewinner werden von einer unabhängigen Jury gewählt. Ausgezeichnet werden Arbeiten, die den Einsatz von Open Source-Software für professionelle Anwender attraktiver machen. Eine Einschränkung auf bestimmte Fachbereiche besteht nicht.\n\nDer Gewinner des Absolventenpreis erhält € 2.000 Preisgeld,  der Zweitplatzierte € 1.000 und der Drittplatzierte gewinnt € 500.\n\nMehr Infos: http://absolventenpreis.de\n",

Tatsächlich steckt im Goldigen eine starke Bewegungsfigur, von der die Netzkultur angetrieben wird – an die allerdings noch einmal erinnert werden muss, um ihre eigentliche Kraft zu entfalten.\r\n",
			"description": "Der Vortrag führt durch Stephan Porombkas eigene Werkstatt hindurch in die Welt der kleinen und kleinsten Formen. Denn an ihnen lässt sich zeigen, auf welche Weise sie in der Netzkultur ihren Stellenwert geändert haben. Weil sie in alten Medienkulturen nur isoliert aufgetreten sind, konnten sie schnell als belanglose Miniaturen abgetan werden. Gerade weil sie sich jetzt aber mit anderen kleinen und kleinsten Formen verknüpfen lassen, entwickeln sie eine ganz neuartige Energie.\nGoldigkeit meint genau diesen Moment, in dem Dinge und Gesten ganz kurz zu leuchten beginnen, weil sie diese Energie abgeben. Klingt esoterisch. Ist aber das Gegenteil. Man hat es hier mit einem ganz konkreten Phänomen zu tun. Gezeigt wird, wie sich dieses Leuchten erzeugen lässt und wozu es sich einsetzen lässt. Entwickeln werden daraus ein paar Hinweise, die nicht die Verwerfungen der Netzkultur glätten, aber immerhin Vorschläge machen, wie man auf produktive Weise Gegenwart beobachten und durch kleine Gesten beeinflussen kann.\n \n",

Men were shocked to find out about the prevalence of sexual harrassment and some demonstrated by wearing skirts and refusing that kind of manhood.

			"description": "Many citizens remain inactive when it comes to political engagement. Their silence is a threat for democracies In times where too many citizens are excluded from political decision making we have to find ways how to better include the silent masses. Digital platforms can be provide tools for participation, however, if not designed carefully they might end up damaging democracy even further. From the Nordics to Latin America, Thomas Wagenknecht from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology analyzed inspiring websites and apps and will present the findings of his research.\nIn addition, the second half of the discussion will focus on freedom of information platforms as one example of citizen/government interaction. The newly launched Sobanukirwa.rw is the first freedom of information project in Rwanda and one of the first in Africa. “Frag den Staat” has been in existence for some years now and has established itself as the portal to government information.\nWhat challenges need to be undertaken to foster active e-citizenship. What are the prerequisites for an effective and active e-participation?What can Freedom of Information projects  learn from each other in making government information accessible to citizens and how can development organizations facilitate governments opening up to become more transparent and accessible? These questions will be debated by  Claude Migisha (Sobanukirwa.rw) and Stefan Wehrmeyer (FragdenStaat.de) and Thomas Wagenknecht.\nThe discussion is hosted and facilitated by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The session will be opened by State Secretary Mr. Silberhorn.\n",

While most people have phones, they often need to pay a fee in order to charge their phone in town. Motorcycles (called “boda boda” in Uganda) are a common transport vehicle. This project allows people to charge their phones using the battery from a motorcycle that is easier accessible than a charging shop.

Youtuber sein ist ein 24 Stunden Job. Wie kann man damit seinen Kühlschrank füllen?\nZählen auf YouTube nur Wachstum, Kohle und dass die Bravo über einen schreibt oder kann man mit der Platform und dem Medium auch ganz andere Dinge bewegen?\n",

			"description": "The global “Maker Movement” is often associated with the trend toward the democratization of technology by means of do-it-yourself culture, open-source sharing, and small scale manufacturing.\nBased on the research and collaboration experiences of the panelists, it seems that in developed countries traditional handicraft and maker cultures are complimenting each other to breath new life and innovation into established traditions. The area of electronics textiles provides a vivid example of how traditional techniques such as knitting, weaving or embroidery can be updated by the maker movement: hobbyists hack their knitting machines with custom-made Arduino boards, and wearable controllers such as the Lilypad together with craft description enable enthusiasts to construct their own wearable devices. Traditional craft such as gold embroidery is rediscovered as a technique to make electric connections.\nHowever, in developing countries this seems to be different: Although informal sector activities often overlap with do-it-yourself culture, many “Maker” initiatives have ignored existing grassroots innovators. Are traditional artisans being colonized by maker initiatives or do we see a revival of traditional culture?\nThe panel will discuss what can be learned from working collaborations and how in future makers and artisans can better collaborate.\n \nThis session is part of the GIG programme\n",

Freifunk is part of the international movement for open wireless radio networks.

			"description": "Die jüngere Geschichte der politischen Regulierung von Technologien, insbesondere im Netzwerk- und Digitalbereich, ist gekennzeichnet von einer Abfolge von Fehlschlägen, Lächerlichkeiten und Verschlimmbesserungen. In Zeiten, in denen Firmen wie Uber primär davon leben, dass sie gerade genug Technik einsetzen, um bestehende Regeln zu unterlaufen, versagen die existierenden Mechanismen des gesellschaftlichen Ausgleichs. Automatisierungstechnologien werden die Arbeitsmärkte in naher Zukunft dramatisch verändern – es ist aber kaum praktikabel, sie auf der Technikebene zu regulieren. Werbefinanzierte Datensammler erfinden neue Überwachungstechniken schneller, als die Datenschützer sie einordnen und regeln können.\n\nUm nicht weiter in diese Fallen zu laufen, ist eine grundlegende Änderung unseres Umgangs mit diesen Problemen nötig.

			"description": "Durch eine Aktion in  der Christ-Erlöser-Kathedrale in Moskau erreichte die russiche Polit-Punkband „Pussy Riot“ weltweite Aufmerksamkeit. Vor dem Altar vollführten sie damals ein „Punk-Gebet“ gegen die Allianz von Kirche und Staat. Als Folge dieser Aktion wurden Nadeschda Tolokonnikowa und Marija zu jeweils zwei Jahren Haft verurteilt. Das Urteil wurde weltweit von Politikern, Menschenrechtlern, Künstlern und Kirchenvertretern als unverhältnismäßig hart kritisiert. Nach zwei Jahren in russischen Straflagern und diversen Hungerstreiks wurden die beiden im Dezember 2013 - rund drei Monate vor dem regulären Ablauf ihrer Haftstrafe - freigelassen. Aljochina bezeichnete ihre Freilassung als „PR-Gag“ in Zusammenhang mit den bevorstehenden Olympischen Winterspielen in Sotschi. Seitdem setzen sich die beiden inzwischen weltbekannten Aktivistinnen für Meinungsfreiheit und Menschenrechte in Russland ein. Sie haben eine Organisation zur Unterstützung politischer Gefangener und ein unabhängiges Nachrichtenportal gegründet.\n",

Im Mittelpunkt stehen dabei die Fragen, welche Rolle Technologie für Inklusion spielen kann und was sich in der Gesellschaft verändern muss, damit Teilhabe und Inklusion gelingen.\n\nTechnologieunternehmen entwickeln intelligente Hard- und Software zur Ortung und Orientierung. Smartphones, Tablets und Computer ersetzen – für deutlich weniger Geld als bisher – traditionelle Hilfsmittel und ermöglichen Menschen mit Behinderungen eine ungeahnte Autonomie. Neuro-Schnittstellen, Sensoren und Exo-Skelette sollen Menschen mit Behinderungen sogar Wahrnehmungs- und Bewegungsfähigkeiten (zurück)geben.\n\nAber welche Chancen und Nebenwirkungen bringen diese neuen „Prothesen“ mit sich?

			"title": "Closed for Migration, Open for Export",
			"abstract": "Borders, it seems, are becoming ever more of a priority to decision makers in Europe, while rights based approaches are fading more and more into the backround; both domestically in terms of strengthening “Fortress Europe” and overseas, sometimes through international aid. Regardless of how it is framed, surveillance technologies and increased data collection play a key part in this move, to the detriment of privacy, dignity and integrity of those affected by EU-refugee policy.",
			"description": "Over the last year, much attention has been given to Europe’s attempts to strengthen its own borders and on the question how to handle world’s biggest refugee crises since World War II; Although the root causes of flight and migration are diverse, the political responses most of the time contain the denial of legal principles, like human dignity.\nIf we look at the projects that international aid coming out of European countries is funding, it seems as though the mentality of strengthening borders and the limitation of migration, rather than tackling its root causes, is being exported to other, less developed countries. International development projects to provide “border security” support are happening all over the world in poorer countries, funded by governments of EU countries.\nWe'll take a closer look at the international development projects that have “strengthening borders” as their main goal to look at the way in which they are using surveillance technologies and handling data: for example, what kinds of data is being collected, where this data might be going, who it belongs to, and – most importantly – whether the privacy rights of people affected by this type of “aid” are being respected, or not. In other sectors, we've seen that there has been a trend of “testing” new technologies on people in less developed countries, before importing them back to Europe – is this also happening here?\nMore than 27,000 migrants have died on their way to Europe since 2000 – if this kind of injustice can happen in Europe, how are other border-strengthening policies being implemented in countries with weaker legislative environments and oversight? \nThis session is hosted by Stiftung Neue Verantwortung \n",

Hier werden nicht nur Menschen mit Hörbehinderung vor Ort bedacht, sondern es sind auch Live-Übertragungen in Fremdsprachen oder in Leichte Sprache möglich und Menschen mit Mobilitätseinschränkungen können im Livestream oder per Smartphone-App folgen.\n\nNicht ganz zufällig entstehen dabei noch qualifizierte Beschäftigungs- und Ausbildungsmöglichkeiten für hörgeschädigte und blinde Dolmetscher: Durch die parallele Erzeugung und Verwendung von Live-Text und Gebärdensprachvideo können taube Gebärdensprachdolmetscher auf der Basis des Live-Texts in ihre Muttersprache, die Gebärdensprache, dolmetschen. Gleichzeitig ermöglichen Spracherkennungssysteme und die barrierefreie Gestaltung der Online-Plattform auch die Beschäftigung von blinden Schriftdolmetschern.\n\nDie Idee: Sprachliche Barrierefreiheit gemeinsam mit internationalen Technologie- und Medienpartnern wird das Angebot für Parlamente und Städte beständig ausgebaut – über HbbTV, Second Screen App oder Video on demand, für alle Sprachen, auf allen Devices – und immer in Echtzeit.\n\n \n\nPräsentiert von Verbavoice.\n",

Is there \"the european way\" compared to northamerican or is norway different than spain and both differ from the UK? And how does Russia think about all this? let's follow me on a short converstation through european communication ways....\nAnna-Marie Vilamovska: Balkan … Innovation: YES, PLEASE!\nThe Balkans had a concerning rep for quite a long time, mirrored in the political science term “balkanization”. Today, the Balkans are showing the other face of disruptive energy – as a drive for innovation, entrepreneurial success and value-added growth. A recent study of Europe’s top start-up destinations placed Sofia, Bulgaria’s capital, 3rd immediately after London and Dublin when it comes to entrepreneurial drive and results. Is it time to change the label?\nThis talk will discuss the case of Bulgaria – the emergence and prospects of its innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. What does it look like? How fragile is this success? What is driving it and what may this ecosystem have to offer?\nTatiana Bazzichelli: Back to the Roots! From Cyberpunk to (Social) Networking in Italy\nCore of this presentation is the development of Italian critical online and offline actions from the early times of “cyberpunk” to social networking contexts. The scope is to compare the diverse use of art and technology among grassroots communities of artists, hackers and activists involved in underground networks, with the contemporary use of social networking platforms. Bazzichelli reconstructs the roots of Italian collaborative media and art practices in which the main developer is a creator of shared networks that expand virally through collective interventions. This presentation introduces also the upcoming event of the Disruption Network Lab in Berlin, when the first English edition of the book: The Cyborg. Essay about the Artificial Man, written by expert of Italian digital counterculture Antonio Caronia (Genoa, 1944 – Milan, 2013) will be launched together with many protagonists of the Italian digital culture and political activism from the 1980s until today.\nFrank Segert: Polen.pl - Hinter der Oder geht's weiter!\nPolen findet in deutschen Medien statt als: a) historischer Ort deutscher Kriegsverbrechen, b) Heimat von Diebesbanden und neuerdings auch als c) modernes Wirtschaftswunderland. Polen.pl hat sich zur Aufgabe gemacht, das Polen-Bild hintergründiger und vielfältiger darzustellen. Wir sind ein Team von Blogger_innen aus derzeit vier Ländern und widmen uns den Themen, die wir spannend und in deutschsprachigen Medien unterrepräsentiert finden.\nBirgit Stöber: Digitales Dänemark - progressiv und (allzu) gutgläubig?\nDänemarks digitale Infrastruktur gehört mit zu den am besten ausgebautesten Europas, und bis zum Jahr 2020 soll es landesweit Breitbandverbindungen mit 100 Mbit/s geben. Dabei stehen die meisten Dänen der Digitialisierung sehr offen gegenüber und haben nur wenig Berührungsängste vor digitalen Alltagslösungen. Ein Grund dafür mag die Verknüpfung der Themen Digitalisierung und Wohlfahrtstaat sein,. Gleichzeitig verwundert das fast vorbehaltlose Vertrauen der Dänen in die digitale Verwaltung.\n",

Für die zukünftige Gestaltung der Städte ist die Beteiligung der Bürgerinnen und Bürger von zentraler Bedeutung. Nur mit ihnen können Städte lebenswert und nachhaltig gestalten werden. Mit dieser Session wird der erste Tag der Subkonferenz Wissenschaftsjahr Zukunftsstadt vom Staatssekretär des BMBF, Stefan Müller sowie Jan Liesegang vom raumlabor Berlin eröffnet.\r\n\r\nArchitektur ist ein experimentelles Baulabor für eine auf den Moment bezogene partizipative Baupraxis im urbanen Raum.

			"description": "\nDas Wissenschaftsjahr 2015 steht im Zeichen der Zukunftsstadt, denn Städte sind Orte der Innovation, des Zusammenlebens und der Interaktion.\nMit der eigene Subkonferenz soll deutlich werden, wie Forschung, Kommunen und Bürgerinnen und Bürger eine nachhaltige Entwicklung in ihren Städten ermöglichen und selbst gestalten können. Zentral ist dabei die Frage: Was macht Städte lebenswert und welche Rolle spielen digitale Entwicklungen sowie Aspekte der Nachhaltigkeit?\nStefan Müller, Staatssekretär des BMBF, wird den ersten Tag der Subkonferenz Zukunftsstadt eröffnen. Seit Dezember 2013 ist Stefan Müller Parlamentarischer Staatssekretär im BMBF und seit 2002 Mitglied des Deutschen Bundestags für Erlangen und Erlangen-Höchstadt. Eine Architektur, in der es gelingt Raum mit individueller Erfahrung zu verschmelzen, lässt neue Qualitäten entdecken, die dazu führen, dass neue Bilder von Stadt entstehen in den Vorstellungen ihrer Nutzer.\nNeue Optionen von Möglichkeiten erscheinen am Horizont von Orten oder Gebäuden an denen zuvor nichts möglich schien, sei es weil sie als zu Ende definiert gelten oder aufgegeben und vergessen wurden. Raumlabor Berlin wurde 1999 als Interessengemeinschaft von mehreren Künstlern und Architekten gegründet, die jeweils projektbezogen und interdisziplinär arbeiten um gemeinsame Ziele in der Architektur, dem Städtebau, Aktionskunst, Landschaftsarchitektur, Gestaltung des öffentlichen Raumes und mit künstlerischen Installationen zu verfolgen. Jan Liesegang, Gründungsmitglied des raumlabors, wird nach einem Grußwort des Staatssekretärs Müller einige Projekte des raumlabors sowie dessen theoretischen Überbau vorstellen und den ersten Tag der Subkonferenz Wissenschaftsjahrs Zukunftsstadt eröffnen.\n \n \n",

Was macht den Unterschied aus? Wie können wir 100 Jahre alte Organisationsformen der Arbeit neu denken? Was braucht es um Effizienz, Innovation, Wissenszuwachs, Menschlichkeit und Spaß bei der Arbeit zu vereinen? Wir sind ein Living Lab welches sich mit diesen Fragen beschäftigt. Als Experten forschen wir gemeinsam, um zu lernen wie echte Kollaboration funktioniert. Dazu entwickeln wir Methoden, Werkzeuge und Umgebungen, die Kollaboration unterstützen – und wenden sie selbst unter wissenschaftlicher Beobachtung an. Unsere guten sowie schlechten Erfahrungen mit Zusammenarbeit sind für jeden einzelnen von uns die Motivation zur Veränderung.\nElektra Wagenrad: Freifunk im TV-Whitespace\nWir brauchen mehr Frequenzspektrum mit größerer Reichweite für die digitalen Commons – eine Chance dazu bietet die digitale Dividende. Das Pilotprojekt der Berliner Freifunker mit der Medienanstalt Berlin-Brandenburg könnte ein erster Schritt zur WLAN-Nutzung im UHF-Band sein.\nJens Schindler: Blog and get paid\nPayPeanuts is a monetisation service that helps bloggers make a living. We are looking for bloggers, who will enjoy working with us on our beta test version. The presentation will show how the service works.\nSaskia Reppin: START-UP CHILE: Changing a country's future through startups\nFour years ago, Start-Up Chile was born. It’s mission -- to literally transform the Chilean entrepreneurial ecosystem. It began with a question. What would happen if we could bring the best and brightest entrepreneurs from all around the globe and insert them into the local ecosystem? We would give them capital to build their companies and a visa to stay. Would they come? Would this have any impact?\n",

The parcel contained a camera which broadcast its journey through the postal system live on the internet. They describe «Delivery for Mr. Assange» as a SYSTEM_TEST and a Live Mail Art Piece.\n",

The phenomenon is an international one and works for various languages.

			"title": "Die Logik von Google und der Anspruch an gute Gesundheitsinformationen",
			"abstract": "Rund 2/3 derjenigen, die im Web nach Gesundheitsinformationen suchen, steigen über eine Suchmaschine ein. Damit lenkt Google häufig, was die Deutschen online über Gesundheit erfahren. Doch wie gehen Googles‘ Maßstäbe für Qualität von Websites mit denen überein, die die evidenzbasierte Medizin an Informationen anlegt? Sind sie vereinbar oder werden dem Nutzerfehlerhafte Inhalte gleichwertig neben guten angezeigt? Und wie verändert sich der „Informationsmarkt“, wenn Google – wie aktuell in den USA – über den Knowledge Graph selbst über Gesundheit und Medizin informiert? ",
			"description": "Im Februar dieses Jahres hat Google angekündigt, Gesundheitsinformationen in den sogenannten Knowledge Graph zu integrieren und damit den Nutzer schon auf „erster Ebene“ der Suchergebnisse selbst über Krankheiten und Behandlungen zu informieren – zunächst in den USA, später weltweit. Die Qualität der Informationen sichert Google zusammen mit Medizinern der renommierten Mayo Clinic. Hintergrund: Schon heute stehe jede 20. Suchanfrage im Zusammenhang mit Gesundheit.\nDie neue Aktivität von Google wirft neues Licht auf die in Deutschland schon seit längerem diskutierte Frage, wie gut die Auswahl an Informationen ist, die Patienten bei einer Internetrecherche erhalten – und wie sehr das Suchmaschinen-Ranking die (vermeintliche) Wertigkeit von Informationen spiegelt. Experten konstatieren, die Nutzer seien im Web einem Dschungel von Informationen ausgesetzt, deren Qualität sie nicht einschätzen können – vieles sei interessengeleitet, ein Großteil der Aussagen nicht wissenschaftlich fundiert. Diskutiert wird, wie sich Orientierung geben lässt, damit der gewachsene Zugang zu Informationen tatsächlich die Autonomie der Patienten fördert und zu besseren Gesundheitsentscheidungen von Patienten und Ärzten führen kann.\nIn der Session wollen wir besprechen, wie weit Googles Qualitätsmaßstäbe mit denen der evidenzbasierten Medizin übereinkommen können oder eben nicht. Wir wollen diskutieren, was gute Gesundheitsinformation ist und wie sie in die Wahrnehmung des Webnutzers gelangt. Und wir wollen fragen, welche Effekte die Informationen über den Knowledge Graph haben können. Ist die Aktivität von Google zu begrüßen, da sie die Informationsflut bändigt und der Nutzer schnell zur „richtigen“ Information gelangt? Oder geraten so mehr vermeintlich gute Informationen außerhalb des Wahrnehmungsfokus? Was tun Anbieter evidenzbasierter Gesundheitsinformationen, um ihre Inhalte „an den Patienten“ zu bringen? \n",

Čapek’s robots however were biological and humanoid, and we would not consider them robots today. Through reflections on the word itself, we’ll discuss the role science fiction plays in forming our perception of science, technology and the future.\nDesigning the Robotic User Experience / Guy Hoffman\nSoon, robots are expected to enter our homes, offices, schools, and nursing homes, our hospitals, battlefields, construction sites, and repair shops. How do we go about designing the user experience for machines that have the most evocative (and ancient) communicative interface: a physical body, moving in space? Also, what can theater acting, Jazz improvisation, and animation teach us to achieve the best robotic user experience?\n \nIn collaboration with the Tel-Aviv Utopia Festival\n",

			"description": "Friends with Benefits – The Tupperwarisation of Social Media / Lior Zalmanson\nHow did our online friendships transform into marketing channels? Communication through social networks, the use of online referrals and the popularity of the crowdfunding business model are creating frequent situations in which users make monetary appeals to their acquaintances and friends circles, convincing them to contribute and to buy, in order to fulfill their personal, financial and business-related goals. What caused this trend, what will it do to our relationships? and what can we learn from the Tupperware parties of the 60's on all of this?\nHow Interfaces Demand Obedience / Mushon Zer-Aviv\nThe internet, once associated with openness and decentralization, is increasingly understood in terms of the control exerted by government agencies (like the NSA) and advertising (targeted ads). What is less commonly discussed is how this subliminal control is embedded in interface design. This talk argues that web interfaces demand our silent obedience with every page load and will try to offer tactics and strategies for challenging the politics of the interface.\n \nIn collaboration with The Tel-Aviv Utopia Festival\n",

Tragbare Gesundheitstools – Wearables sollen uns helfen noch gesünder zu bleiben. Um zu verstehen, was wir Gesunde, Patienten_innen und Ärzte_innen mit diesen Systemen können und wie können wir Teilnehmer des Gesundheitswesens diese Entwicklung aktiv mit gestalten?",
			"description": "Auf der medizinisch zertifizierten Ebene existieren eine Reihe von sinnvollen Systemen, die Patienten_innen helfen. Seien es autonom gesteuerte Insulinpumpen für Diabetiker, Herzfrequenzmonitore und Stimulatoren für chronisch Herzkranke, Sensorpflaster, die durch elektrische Stimulation Schmerzen behandeln, tragbare Systeme zur Behandlung von Epilepsien, alle Systeme basieren auf immer feineren Sensoren, die für den Träger unmerklich in Kleidung eingewoben, die gesicherte medizinische Daten erheben und diese in einem professionellen Umfeld speichern und interpretieren können.\nAuf der Konsumentenseite, also die der medizinischen Laien verstehen wir unter tragbaren medizinischen Geräten Systeme, die spezielle Funktionalitäten wie Pulsmessung, Körpertemperatur, Hautleitfähigkeit, Gewicht und ähnliche Funktionen in Uhren oder Smartphones mit eingebaut haben. Was passiert jedoch mit den erhobenen Daten, der zum großen Teil ja für den nichtmedizinischen Markt erstellten Systeme. Stellen wir die unseren Ärzten zur Verfügung? Haben Ärzte_innen wirklich Angst vor gut informierten, sich selbst vermessenden, mit denkenden Patienten_innen? Sollen unsere Ärzte_innen und Krankenversicherungen uns überhaupt so nah kommen, dass unser Gesundheitsverhalten auch schon vor dem Beginn einer Erkrankung nahtlos aufgezeichnet wird?  \nDie Zweischneidigkeit des unreflektierten und unregulierten Einsatzes dieser Messsysteme lässt sich an der raschen Verbreitung von sogenannten \"Fitness-Apps\" belegen. Diese gaukeln den Anwender_innen einen gesünderen Lebensstil vor, instrumentalisieren die Nutzer_innen aber vor allem für Marketingzwecke. Und sie stimulieren die ungeschützte Freigabe dieser Informationen in sozialen Netzwerken. Die Anwender_innen werden auf diese Weise korrumpiert, einen der intimsten Lebensbereiche – Gesundheitsverhalten – durch Preisgabe Ihres Lebensstils in die Öffentlichkeit zu tragen. Die nächste Stufe dieser Anwendungen wird von privaten Anbietern geführte elektronische Patientenakten anbieten, durch die im schlimmsten Falle auch hochsensible medizinische Daten in unbefugte Hände gelangen können.\n",

Die letzten 2 Tweets handeln von: Brustvergrößerungen. Zufall?! Den Twitter-Feed runtergescrollt & ausgewertet: etwa 20% der Tweets fallen auf „Schönheits-Operationen“, nur 3,7% betreffen Besuche beim Hausärzte. Merkwürdig?! Wie nicht nur Körperregionen sondern auch Bewertungsvolumina „legal“ aufgehübscht werden, erklärt die Session. ",
			"description": "Sicherlich ist der Schritt zur Schönheitsoperation überlegt. Der Patient informiert sich vorab und dies natürlich auch im Internet. Dabei landet sie oder er zwangsläufig auf den Bewertungsportalen. Genauso wie man sich vor dem Kauf in einem Online-Shop die Kommentare von anderen Kunden durchliest, werden sicherlich auch die Arztbewertungen der Schönheitschirurgen gelesen. Vermutlich sogar noch intensiver: während man das Buch von Amazon oder den Schuh von Zalando bei Nichtgefallen einfach wieder zurück senden kann, bleibt die Schönheits-OP ein \"einschneidendes\" Erlebnis.\n\nPlastische und Ästhetische Chirurgen haben auf Arztbewertungsportalen in der Regel mehrere Hundert, die \"Spitzenreiter\" über Tausend Bewertungen. Der eigene Hausarzt hingegen hat nicht mal eine Hand voll. Sind die Einen einfach besser und bekommen deshalb von den Patienten mehr Bewertungen?\n\nDie \"Spitzenreiter\" von Portal A sind oft auf anderen großen Bewertungsportalen nur mit ganz wenigen Bewertungen vertreten. Anders rum gibt es Ärzte, die auf Portal A wenige Bewertungen haben, dafür aber auf anderen Portalen Spitzenpositionen einnehmen. Wie geht das?! Schreiben sich die Ärzte ihre Bewerbungen selber?! Nicht auszuschliessen, aber wir sind hier nicht bei ebay! Es gibt andere, elegantere Wege.\n\nDas Grundprinzip dahinter ist so einfach wie banal: ein Arzt ist stark auf dem Portal, bei dem er ein kostenpflichtiges Premium Account unterhält. Aber was sind das denn für durchgreifende\n\nServices, die es dort für schlappe 99 Euro im Monat gibt?!\n\nDiese Session richtet sich als letzte Chance an\n\nLeute, die „sich gerade eine guten Chirurgen im Internet gesucht haben“,\n\tärztliche Kollegen, die auch „oben mitmischen“ wollen und\n\tBewertungsportalbetreiber jeglicher Art, die noch ein paar perfide, Tricks (von namenhaften Ärzten getestet!) auf dem Weg zu glücklichen, brav-zahlenden Premium-Kunden brauchen. \n",

			"description": "Markus Strecker: Tech in Motion\nFashion and Technology are living in two different worlds. Only recently they had the courage to move towards each other. Seriously move towards each other. Because we are not talking about prototypes or demonstrators. We mean products that can be industrialized. And that is one of the key challenges for successful smart fashion products. Another is the seamless integration of the technology. In this talk you will see a product example for a successful merger of fashion and technology and learn about the evolvement  of fashionable technology over the past decade.\nThomas Gnahm: The Day You Will Choose Your Jacket by It's Social Network – The Social Factor in Wearable Electronics\nSummary: New technology in textiles not only develops the fashion scene with gadgets and light effects, but changes our social behavior in a digital society. Our clothing will keep us connected, for example with our friends, and indeed permanently as a medium for communication. We will be able to feel things and the clothes will be our sixth sense. During my talk, we will explore how we can benefit as men of new technology into the field of fashion, how technology currently exists and what visions could accompany the this.\n",

For instance, by placing 54 cables, 18 sensors, and 18 actuators, onto the palm of the hand. In this talk, we will explore the journey of developing dbGLOVE, a wearable device that provides people with combined vision and hearing impairments with the possibility of being independent in communicating with others and in interacting with the world.\nPietro Oluyede: Enabling One-off Apparel Design for the Consumer via Technology\nEveryone is looking for uniqueness, mostly into the fashion segment. Now, if you are a smartphone or tablet owner (and you are), in this workshop you’ll learn how you can easily design a one-off graphic that will be printed on the handmade piece of clothing that you’ll receive at home. We’ll demonstrate that with our app every mind can be so creative to approach with ease a fashion design process. \n",

			"description": "Monika Kanokova: Community Power – From Ideation to Market\nCreating fashion has always been a financially sensitive undertaking; the industry is based on guesses and estimates and requires high investments before you even know whether the people you’re targeting to respond to your ideas. So how do you bring your creations to market without the financial risk and find the people to whom your creative process truly matters?\nHristiyana Vucheva: Building Synergy between Luxury Fashion and Digital Transformation\nLuxury jewelry design is a relatively conservative industry with regards to the production and materials. Digital technologies and production innovations are often seen as unusual and unnecessary because the traditions and values of high-end jewelry-making are strongly based on handmade artisanship. That’s why most of the accomplished brands in the upmarket segment focus on the tried and tested, instead of exploring the experimental, risky zone new technologies are opening.\nThis talk will focus on the main creative, production and business advantages that digital manufacturing, and more specifically the 3D printing technologies, can offer fashion, jewelry designers and labels.\n",

This session will provide insights on how speech and gestures impact the way we communicate and interact with each other as well as with our surroundings and also proves how powerful gestures can be for expressing ourselves.",
			"description": "Imagine that our navigation systems would know what we want with just some little gestures or using voice control for driving our cars. Philipp Wex is working on such technologies and will give us some insights on the process and technical approaches of speech interaction within an automobile. Now we can use speech and gestures to steer our cars – about time we had a look at digital body language and how to understand each other’s non-verbal cues across digital boarders. In Vanessa van Edward’s contribution to the session we will use the latest research on online human behavior to learn about the concept of digital body language and how our body language and the usage of gestures change in our mobile and digital environment: Do we use different gestures today? How can we make use of these with regard to the mobile world and the future of mobility? And why is it becoming so important? With his performance of poetry in sign language, Mathias Schäfer will bring us back to Berlin and show us the power of gestures and movement for storytelling and a unique view on the future of mobility.\n",

			"description": "The discourse on sustainability is basically a new playground for capitalism. Our human ‘activities of understanding’ have created a dependency on data, information and knowledge. This comes —as Georg Franck notes— at a high price of time and energy resources. According to this assumption contemporary technology driven sustainability efforts may produce surplus of ‚non-material’ information parallel to shortness of ‚material’ resources.\n\nThis reflection on sustainability is the base for our thoughts about the relationship among nature, technology and human practice on the example of fashion and textiles.\n",

			"description": "A business-model that hasn't changed for decades: modeling and casting agencies. Finding new faces (preferable in particular sizes) and distributing them to photographers, advertisers or designers. A decent business back in analog times. Intermediates like agencies charge models and clients commission and fees - not adding any value in most cases. The pure mediation between models and clients is pretty expansive. The team behind the StartUp manneqn believes that clients and models can be matched more efficiently. With a bigger variety for the clients to choose from - assisted by an intelligent algorithm, finding the perfect model for the particular context. The models, on the other hand, benefit from more requests, no commissions or fees to pay and the freedom to build up a comprehensible reputation on one central platform on their smartphone. Making models independent again is the central approach behind manneqn. Disrupting the model-booking business as it is known today by giving back the power to the models. \n",

Und doch bleiben die Plätze in der Geschäftsführung und im Aufsichtsrat oft männlich besetzt – doch warum? Machen diese Maßnahmen keinen Sinn? Können Frauen die Maßnehmen nicht umsetzen, Hilfen nicht annehmen? Oder begegnen ihnen vielleicht ganz andere Hürden als die Maßnahmen zu überwinden versuchen? Und welche Rolle spielt Diversity hier – wie sieht die Zusammenarbeit von Mann und Frau im modernen Business-Alltag aus? Unser Panel beleuchtet diese und andere Fragen aus ganz unterschiedlichen Perspektiven: Was Unternehmen tun können, welche Rolle Männer bei der Frauenführungsfrage spielen, welche Probleme Führungsfrauen tatsächlich begegnen und wie sich Frauen heute selbst organisieren kann man hier erfahren und zusätzlich Antworten auf die eigenen Fragen von den vier Expertinnen bekommen.\n",

Videoprototyping is not only a lean way to get the story of your product transferred into moving pictures. It is also a good way to present UX-flows for digital user interfaces.\n\nFor both use cases we use simple papercuts - storyelements or mockups.\n\nIn this session we will experiment with live videoprototyping and testing, guiding a few volunteers through a prototype of a digital product, while projecting the test on a screen, hoping to collect even more feedback from the audience.\n\nThis form of testing is going to be a prototype too - let's learn from it.\n\never tried, ever failed no matter try again fail again fail better Samuel Beckett\n",

			"abstract": "First, Antoine93 will perform a set of his refreshing, new pop music. After the concert, the organizers and curators of Torstraßenfestival will be available for meetings and questions - we are happy to give you a view behind the scenes, how we make the festival possible, how we approach booking, partnerships, organization etc. Also, if you would like to collaborate, have ideas you'd like to share etc. - just come by, we are happy to meet you.\r\n",
			"description": "Antoine93: The line is hard to draw between the genuine, heartfelt aspect of Antoine's music and it's bold, campy features. Yet, the performer manages to create a strong, finished product out of what would otherwise seem like a jarring combination. After three years in the intimate family that is the Montreal music scene, Antoine made of Berlin his new home, letting the project expand and reach new horizons. Consequently, his latest release, Maybe Unlock My Heart, was made under Mansions&Millions in december 2014. As a self-sufficient artist, digital matters are amongst Antoine's main concerns, since they -now more then ever- play an important role in both creative and promotional aspects of music making.\n\nTorstraßen Festival: For the 5th time Torstraßen Festival takes place on Saturday, June 13th from 2 – 12pm at 10 locations in Berlin-Mitte. In cooperation with venues, cafés, shops and bars in our neighborhood we present a musical matinee showcase with a current leftfield and cross-genre soundtrack. We see ourselves and our festival goers as explorers, who are not afraid to trust their curiosity instead of big headliners. We strive to be a forum for current and relevant development within Berlin’s music scenes: for locals, transients and their influencers.\n",

In Zeiten, in denen tausende Deutsche zum Marathonlaufen nach NYC fliegen und der Wille nach persönlichen Herausforderungen ein absoluter Pluspunkt in jedem Bewerbungsgespräch sind, dreht sich vieles im Leben genau darum: Höher, Weiter, Schneller, Abenteuerlicher. Gunther Holtorf nimmt uns mit auf seine Reise: 900.000 Kilometer und 215 Länder in 26 Jahren.  ",
			"description": "Persönliche Herausforderungen prägen unsere Zeit und sie tun genau das: Sie fordern. Sei es Zeit, Nerven, Kraft, Wille oder Ausdauer. Aber sie geben uns auch etwas zurück, sie pushen uns, lassen uns weiter kommen, als wir selbst uns zugetraut oder gedacht hätten. Oftmals ist es ein einfacher Auslöser, der uns in etwas Größeres stürzt. Das Joggen im Park wird zum Ironman auf Hawaii, der Kräutergarten auf dem Balkon zum riesen Gartenprojekt oder ein Urlaub zu einer Weltreise. Letztes war der Quest von Gunther Holtorf, der mit seiner G-Klasse durch die Lande gezogen ist.  Alles fing an mit einem Auto, das auf den Namen Otto hört und einer ersten Reise, der unzählige weitere folgten. Nun hat die G-Klasse 900.000 Kilometer auf dem Buckel, Gunther Holtorf 215 Länder besucht und 26 Jahre seines Lebens mit Reisen verbracht. Otto, fast schon ein Familienmitglied, sind für ihn mehr als seine vier Räder, die ihn und die Mitreisenden immer begleitet haben, über Stock und Stein, durch Wälder, Wüste und Wasser. Gunther Holtorf und Otto gehören zusammen, seine Reise und seine Räder. Nun nimmt er uns mit auf diese Reise. \n",

			"abstract": "The Master degree should enable to operate on a reasonably high level within all the sectors of the creative industry, as junior manager, consultant or as “midwife” of creative companies driven by the creative class, but with relatively little knowledge of management expertise. Therefore, the course should aim at hands-on knowledge rather than theories. The minimal cut set between the sectors should be the guideline of activity concerning methods and knowledge. Master of CIM is an exciting course, offering the opportunity to develop professional leadership and strategic business skills for the creative industries including design, fashion, games and digital media. This creative Master is aimed at ambitious professionals from all disciplines, who share a common goal to build business value through entrepreneurship, strategic management and innovation in the creative industries.",
			"description": "Creative industries have become a relevant part of our economy. The digital shift is a major driver.  Berlin is a booming hotspot in the sector. Almost on a weekly basis, international players start activities in the city. Founders of all nationalities set up countless startups here. The main reasons for the attractiveness of Berlin are the tolerant and open atmosphere, its internationality, but also hard factors such as relatively low costs of living and rent and a large pool of dedicated and highly qualified professionals. However, when the growth continues or even expands, the city will need a continuous feed of specialists. The impact on the educational system is yet unexplored. bbw Hochschule has decided to contribute to closing this gap and to set up this new master program starting in fall 2015. For the first time, a German university of applied science is starting a master program, dedicated to the management of the creative industries as a whole. This holistic approach has the advantage, that it enables proactive responses to the drastic changes within the industry. We look mainly onto the transversal subjects of different creative industries.  It also can apply new emerging competences such as trans- sectorial intellectual property management, crowd funding and community based marketing. Management of creative industries follows an holistic approach. Management traditions and the crafts of the sectors are still relatively different. On the other side, transversal competences emerge, which are specific to more or less all sectors of the creative economy. Additionally, the sectorial break-up of the creative economy is shifting drastically - creative industries are increasingly characterized by a growing interdisciplinary dynamic. Disruptive innovations, the profession’s specificities and constantly new inputs will enhance the challenge to keep the open, holistic approach without becoming pointless and superficial. Therefore, it is important to set up a very concrete “hands on” education so that we can keep our promise towards the students.  \n\nbbw-hochschule.de\n",

Die Veranstalter, die in erster Linie auf männliche Speaker setzen, begründen ihre Entscheidung immer wieder mit: „Wir hätten gerne mehr Frauen, finden aber keine.“ Das wollen wir ändern!\n\nspeakerinnen.org ist vor diesem Hintergrund entstanden und bietet eine Plattform, um die Frauen sichtbar und auffindbar zu machen, die gerne öffentlich über ihre Themen sprechen. Das Projekt ist vor gut einem Jahr gestartet und wurde von acht Programmieranfängerinnen der Rails Girls Berlin entwickelt. Anstoß gab Anne Roth, die sich schon seit Langem mit dem ungleichen Geschlechterverhältnis auf den Bühnen beschäftigt.\n\nMaren Heltsche wird über die Erfolge, Herausforderungen und die nächsten Schritte berichten.\n\n \n",

Die Gebärdensprache hat mit ihrer Räumlichkeit und gestischen wie mimischen Audrucksweise viel mehr zu bieten.

Dort wollten 9000 Menschen aller Altersklassen sehen und erleben, woran in den Garagen und Hackerspaces geschraubt wird. Sie kehrten nicht nur mit leuchtenden Augen und neuen Ideen, sondern auch mit selbst gelöteten oder geschmiedeten Projekten nach Hause zurück.\n\nIm Oktober 2015 kommt die Maker Faire erstmalig nach Berlin - auch unterstützt von newthinking. Wer sind diese Maker? War das mit dem Basteln eigentlich je weg? Und: Ist das nur Faszination oder eigentlich doch Bildung? Philip Steffan, Redakteur beim deutschen Make-Magazin, organisiert die Maker Faire mit und wird sie vorstellen.  \n",
